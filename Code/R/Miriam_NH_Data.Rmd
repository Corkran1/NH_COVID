Problems of shared staffing 

CNA (AIDE in the data) certified nursery aid has less training and sometimes works on more than one nursery home (spend more time with residents).  

LPN licensed practicing nurses  are in the middle

RN Registered Nurses are the ones with more training and better salaries  

Does the CNA have more risk of spreading the disease into nursering homes??

# Miriam data

```{r}
### Load the libraries
library(dplyr); library(sf); library(ggplot2)   
## Load Data
key_nh <- readxl::read_xlsx("../../Data/Alec/Data Documentation.xlsx")
nh_data <- read.csv("../../Data/Alec/full_Aug16_nh_data.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)
key_nh

nh_data[nh_data == 'N'] <- 0
nh_data[nh_data == 'Y'] <- 1
```

Does all recent testing done of staff variables should sum the total tests done to the staff?

```{r}
nh_data %>%
  count(staff_week_test) # most of the facilities can test the staff in a week, if we knowthe number of tests, we know the number of staff?
```



```{r}
nh_data %>%
  filter(state.x == "CA") %>%
  group_by(provcity) %>%
  summarise(sum(res_total_conf_covid), mean(AIDHRD), mean(VOCHRD), mean(RNHRD))
```

```{r}
nh_data %>%
  filter(FPN == 555881)
```

AIDHRD - Aide staff hours per resident day
VOCHRD - LPN staff hours per resident
RNHRD - RN staff hours per resident
PTHRD - Physical theraphy hour per resident day

```{r}
nh_data %>%

nh_data %>%
  count(county.x, county.y) # joined database? why?

```{r}
nh_data %>%
  filter(state.x == "CA", !is.na(geolocation)) %>% 
  mutate(geom = st_point(geolocation))

  stringr::str_split_fixed(string = ., pattern = " ", n = 2) %>%
  gsub(pattern = "([^0-9.-])", replacement = "", x = .)

nh_sp <- nh_data %>%

  st_as_sf(., coords = c('x', 'y')) %>%
  select(county.x, provname, provadd, provcity, num_beds)

st_write(nh_sp, "Data/Spatial/nh_sp.shp")
```

 
  
```{r}
nh_data %>%
  filter(provname == "MILLER'S MERRY MANOR") # data has multiple prov, different locations?

nh_data %>%
  filter(provadd == "#1 ARBOR TERRACE") # Why some duplicate locations? county_cases, fips, county_case_rate different
```


# Questions for meeting:
  
  - How can we represent the residents with which each type of staff interacted with? 
  - How can we approximate the number of staff for each type?  
  - How many times per day a patient is contacted (attended)?  
  -
