# Methods

## Population

We present a spatial explicit stochastic agent based model that recreates the day to day dynamics in a typical nursery home during the COVID pandemic in the United States. We use an hourly time step resolution and we ran the model for 150 days.

### Population structure

We used the floor plans and satellite imagery to recreate the spatial structure of a typical nursery home in the US (figure 1). The nursery home consist on 58 bedrooms designated for the residents, recreation areas (such as dining room, and activities rooms), and rooms for staff use. In the initial conditions there are 3 residents per room (total 174) and 170 staff divided into 3 different turns. The decision on the population distribution was based on information obtained from an interview with a nursery home in California.

### Population dynamics

In our simulation, an agent can interact with other agents based on its location. Given the current guidelines of recommendations for long term care facilities, there are no visitations and the residents spend most of the day in their rooms, so they can only interact with their roommates and the staff. In our model each resident will have at least one interaction with the staff per day which is based on different contact rates depending on the staff type (CN, RN, LPN), The staff will have different contact rates that were parametrized according on the average number of resident contacts in a normal day (REFERENCE: Table shared via email??). The contact rates are presented in table from supplementary materials.

| Type of staff | Distribution of resident contacts per turn |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------|
| CN            | $x\sim Mult(n,\pi)$                      |
| RN            | $x\sim Mult(n,\pi)$                      |
| LPN           | $x\sim Mult(n,\pi)$                      |

The staff agents are assigned to one of 3 different work schedules (morning, afternoon or night) and they spend 8 hours inside the nursery home and the rest of the time outside in the community. We only follow the agents inside the nursery home and when the agents are outside we assume that they all have the same probability of contacting other people.

### Disease dynamics:

The transmission between agents inside the facility will depend on two parts, which are the probability that a person will shed the virus and the probability that another person will get the virus. We decided on model the transmission this way to represent scenarios where the infected and susceptible could have different combination of interventions (i.e. only infected received the intervention, only susceptible received the intervention, both received the intervention, etc..). The parametrization of the transmission parameters was based on observed outbreaks in nursery homes in California.

The introduction from the community to the facility depends on a parameter *Introduction\_p* that represents how likely is that a staff agent will be infected in the community.

All the agents start as susceptible and after 1 day there is a resident introduced with the disease. Then we follow up for 150 days or until the disease has been absent for more than 14 simulation days. Once the transmission between a infectious agent to a susceptible agent has been successful, the susceptible agent becomes exposed and based on a distribution for the latent period $\lambda$, the agent becomes infectious after $\lambda$ number of days, which can be either symptomatic and asymptomatic. The agent can infect other agents only when its in the Infectious state, then they remain infectious during 15 days and they transition to recovered. The agents can transition to infectious to hospitalized at any moment based on the hospitalization rate. When the agents has been recovered they acquire infection immunity, which lasts for ___ days.

## Interventions

We explore 3 different COVID-19 control strategies and the combination of them. Each of the interventions have an impact in the transmission of the disease, interventions such as the use of PPE and vaccination reduces the probability of transmission affecting directly the *Shedding* and *Infection probability*, while the isolation affects the transmission indirectly stopping the agent to interact with other agents.
The equation 1 shows the effect of *PPE effect* and *Vaccine effect* on the transmission probability, where $odds_\omega$ represent the global transmission probability for all agents, $OR_\gamma$ represent the odds ratio for the *PPE effect*, and $OR\pi$ is the *Vaccine effect*. This probability is computed for all agents at each step so we can have different probabilities of transmission based on the interventions each individual received.  

$$p_T = \frac{e^{\ln(odds_\omega) + \ln(OR_\pi)+ \ln(OR_\upsilon)}}{1 + e^{\ln(odds_\omega) + \ln(OR_\pi)+ \ln(OR_\upsilon)}}$$
For the implementation of the vaccination, we specified by the proportion of residents and staff vaccinated, and a fixed interval between the first and second dose. Then the vaccination immunity will have a decay of 120 days and the individual will no longer have the vaccination immunity protective effect.

Since there is still some uncertainty in the effect of the use of PPE and the vaccine for older population, we started with values that are within the range of reported values and then varied these values for the sensitivity analysis and scenario modeling.

### Testing and isolation

Our model represents the testing of the population with 2 different approaches:  

  - Passive, individuals are tested once that they present symptoms, this approach is focused on the early detection of symptomatic individuals.
  - Active, a proportion of individuals are tested with a given frequency. In baseline scenario, 1 resident per room and all the staff are tested weekly. If 1 of the residents in a room is detected positive, the rest of the residents in that room are also tested.
  
Once a individual has been detected positive is isolated. There are special isolation rooms for the residents and in the case of the staff they are sent home. Once the individual is tested negative it return to the facility.
