abstract = {A novel coronavirus disease, designated as COVID-19, has become a pandemic worldwide. This study aimed to estimate the incubation period and serial interval of COVID-19. We collected contact tracing data in a municipality in Hubei province during a full outbreak period. The date of infection and infector-infectee pairs were inferred from the history of travel in Wuhan or exposed to confirmed cases. The incubation periods and serial intervals were estimated using parametric accelerated failure time models, accounting for interval censoring of the exposures. Our estimated median incubation period of COVID-19 is 5.4 days (bootstrapped 95{\%} CI: 4.8-6.0), and the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles are 1 and 15 days respectively; while the estimated serial interval of COVID-19 falls within the range of -4 to 13 days with 95{\%} confidence and has a median of 4.6 days (95{\%} CI: 3.7-5.5). Ninety-five per cent of symptomatic cases showed symptoms by 13.7 days (95{\%} CI: 12.5-14.9). The incubation periods and serial intervals were not significant different between male and female, and among age groups. Our results suggest a considerable proportion of secondary transmission occurred prior to symptom onset. And the current practice of 14-day quarantine period in many regions is reasonable.},

abstract = {Background: In the face of rapidly changing data, a range of case fatality ratio estimates for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude. We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases. Methods: We collected individual-case data for patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020). These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital). We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment. We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China. Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio. Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation. Findings: Using data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17{\textperiodcentered}8 days (95{\%} credible interval [CrI] 16{\textperiodcentered}9–19{\textperiodcentered}2) and to hospital discharge to be 24{\textperiodcentered}7 days (22{\textperiodcentered}9–28{\textperiodcentered}1). In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70 117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3{\textperiodcentered}67{\%} (95{\%} CrI 3{\textperiodcentered}56–3{\textperiodcentered}80). However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1{\textperiodcentered}38{\%} (1{\textperiodcentered}23–1{\textperiodcentered}53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0{\textperiodcentered}32{\%} [0{\textperiodcentered}27–0{\textperiodcentered}38] in those aged {\textless}60 years vs 6{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} [5{\textperiodcentered}7–7{\textperiodcentered}2] in those aged ≥60 years), up to 13{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} (11{\textperiodcentered}2–15{\textperiodcentered}9) in those aged 80 years or older. Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} [0{\textperiodcentered}4–3{\textperiodcentered}5] in those aged {\textless}60 years [n=360] and 4{\textperiodcentered}5{\%} [1{\textperiodcentered}8–11{\textperiodcentered}1] in those aged ≥60 years [n=151]). Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0{\textperiodcentered}66{\%} (0{\textperiodcentered}39–1{\textperiodcentered}33), with an increasing profile with age. Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 18{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} (11{\textperiodcentered}0–37{\textperiodcentered}6) in those aged 80 years or older. Interpretation: These early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and show a strong age gradient in risk of death.

abstract = {Objectives: To prevent and control COVID-19 infections, nursing homes across the world have taken very restrictive measures, including a ban for visitors. These restrictive measures have an enormous impact on residents' well-being and pose dilemmas for staff, although primary data are lacking. A Dutch guideline was developed to cautiously open nursing homes for visitors during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study reports the first findings on how the guideline was applied in the local context; the compliance to local protocols; and the impact on well-being of residents, their family caregivers, and staff. Design: A mixed-methods cross-sectional study was conducted. Setting and Participants: In total, 26 nursing homes were permitted to enlarge their possibilities for allowing visitors in their facility. These nursing homes were proportionally representative of the Netherlands as they were selected by their local Area Health Authority for participation. At each nursing home, a contact person was selected for participation in the current study. Methods: A mixed-methods cross-sectional study was conducted, consisting of questionnaire, telephone interviews, analyses of documentation (ie, local visiting protocols), and a WhatsApp group. Results: Variation in local protocols was observed, for example, related to the use of personal protective equipment, location, and supervision of visits. In general, experiences were very positive. All nursing homes recognized the added value of real and personal contact between residents and their loved ones and indicated a positive impact on well-being. Compliance with local guidelines was sufficient to good. No new COVID-19 infections were reported during this time. Conclusions and Implications: These results indicate the value of family visitation in nursing homes and positive impact of visits. Based on these results, the Dutch government has decided to allow all nursing homes in the Netherlands to cautiously open their homes using the guidelines. More research is needed on impact and long-term compliance.},

abstract = {There is a new public health crises threatening the world with the emergence and spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) or the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus originated in bats and was transmitted to humans through yet unknown intermediary animals in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in December 2019. There have been around 96,000 reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and 3300 reported deaths to date (05/03/2020). The disease is transmitted by inhalation or contact with infected droplets and the incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 d. The symptoms are usually fever, cough, sore throat, breathlessness, fatigue, malaise among others. The disease is mild in most people; in some (usually the elderly and those with comorbidities), it may progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi organ dysfunction. Many people are asymptomatic. The case fatality rate is estimated to range from 2 to 3{\%}. Diagnosis is by demonstration of the virus in respiratory secretions by special molecular tests. Common laboratory findings include normal/ low white cell counts with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). The computerized tomographic chest scan is usually abnormal even in those with no symptoms or mild disease. Treatment is essentially supportive; role of antiviral agents is yet to be established. Prevention entails home isolation of suspected cases and those with mild illnesses and strict infection control measures at hospitals that include contact and droplet precautions. The virus spreads faster than its two ancestors the SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), but has lower fatality. The global impact of this new epidemic is yet uncertain.},

To overcome this problem, the countries have adopted different policies for controlling the spread of the virus. This paper proposes the COVID-ABS, a new SEIR agent-based model that aims to simulate the pandemic dynamics using a society of agents emulating people, business and government. Seven different scenarios varying epidemiological and economical effects of social distance interventions were performed, which are: (1) do nothing, (2) lockdown, (3) conditional lockdown, (4) vertical isolation, (5) partial isolation, (6) use of face masks, and (7) use of face masks together with 50{\%} of adhesion to social isolation. In the impossibility of implementing scenarios with lockdown which present the lowest number of deaths and highest impact on the economy, scenarios combining the use of face masks and partial isolation can be the more realistic for implementation in terms of social cooperation. The model can be easily extended to new societies by varying the parameters as well as allows the creating of a multitude of other scenarios.},

abstract = {Importance: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused epidemic spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the Seattle, Washington, metropolitan area, with morbidity and mortality concentrated among residents of skilled nursing facilities. The prevalence of COVID-19 among older adults in independent/assisted living is not understood. Objectives: To conduct surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 and describe symptoms of COVID-19 among residents and staff of an independent/assisted living community. Design, Setting, and Participants: In March 2020, public health surveillance of staff and residents was conducted on site at an assisted and independent living residence for older adults in Seattle, Washington, after exposure to 2 residents who were hospitalized with COVID-19. Exposures: Surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a congregate setting implementing social isolation and infection prevention protocols. Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs from residents and staff; a symptom questionnaire was completed assessing fever, cough, and other symptoms for the preceding 14 days. Residents were retested for SARS-CoV-2 7 days after initial screening. Results: Testing was performed on 80 residents; 62 were women (77{\%}), with mean age of 86 (range, 69-102) years. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 3 of 80 residents (3.8{\%}); none felt ill, 1 male resident reported resolved cough and 1 loose stool during the preceding 14 days. Virus was also detected in 2 of 62 staff (3.2{\%}); both were symptomatic. One week later, resident SARS-CoV-2 testing was repeated and 1 new infection detected (asymptomatic). All residents remained in isolation and were clinically stable 14 days after the second test. Conclusions and Relevance: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic residents highlights challenges in protecting older adults living in congregate settings. In this study, symptom screening failed to identify residents with infections and all 4 residents with SARS-CoV-2 remained asymptomatic after 14 days. Although 1 asymptomatic infection was found on retesting, a widespread facility outbreak was avoided. Compared with skilled nursing settings, in assisted/independent living communities, early surveillance to identify asymptomatic persons among residents and staff, in combination with adherence to recommended preventive strategies, may reduce viral spread..},

abstract = {The coronavirus pandemic is one of the biggest health crises of our time. In response to this global problem, various institutions around the world had soon issued evidence-based prevention guidelines. However, these guidelines, which were designed to slow the spread of COVID-19 and contribute to public well-being, are (deliberately) disregarded by some individuals. In the present study, we aimed to develop and test a multivariate model that could help us identify individual characteristics that make a person more/less likely to comply with COVID-19 prevention guidelines. A total of 525 attentive participants completed the online survey. The results of structural equation modeling (SEM) show that COVID-19 risk perception and trust in science both independently predict compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines, while the remaining variables in the model (political conservatism, religious orthodoxy, conspiracy ideation and intellectual curiosity) do so via the mediating role of trust in science. The described model exhibited an acceptable fit ($\chi$2(1611) = 2485.84, p {\textless}.001, CFI =.91, RMSEA =.032, SRMR =.055). These findings thus provide empirical support for the proposed multivariate model and underline the importance of trust in science in explaining the different levels of compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines.},

abstract = {It is widely believed that protecting health care facilities against outbreaks of pandemic influenza requires pharmaceutical resources such as antivirals and vaccines. However, early in a pandemic, vaccines will not likely be available and antivirals will probably be of limited supply. The containment of pandemic influenza within acute-care hospitals anywhere is problematic because of open connections with communities. However, other health care institutions, especially those providing care for the disabled, can potentially control community access. We modeled a residential care facility by using a stochastic compartmental model to address the question of whether conditions exist under which nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) alone might prevent the introduction of a pandemic virus. The model projected that with currently recommended staff-visitor interactions and social distancing practices, virus introductions are inevitable in all pandemics, accompanied by rapid internal propagation. The model identified staff reentry as the critical pathway of contagion, and provided estimates of the reduction in risk required to minimize the probability of a virus introduction. By using information on latency for historical and candidate pandemic viruses, we developed NPIs that simulated notions of protective isolation for staff away from the facility that reduced the probability of bringing the pandemic infection back to the facility to levels providing protection over a large range of projected pandemic severities. The proposed form of protective isolation was evaluated for social plausibility by collaborators who operate residential facilities.

abstract = {Objective: To estimate the serial interval of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from information on 28 infector-infectee pairs. Methods: We collected dates of illness onset for primary cases (infectors) and secondary cases (infectees) from published research articles and case investigation reports. We subjectively ranked the credibility of the data and performed analyses on both the full dataset (n = 28) and a subset of pairs with highest certainty in reporting (n = 18). In addition, we adjust for right truncation of the data as the epidemic is still in its growth phase. Results: Accounting for right truncation and analyzing all pairs, we estimated the median serial interval at 4.0 days (95{\%} credible interval [CrI]: 3.1, 4.9). Limiting our data to only the most certain pairs, the median serial interval was estimated at 4.6 days (95{\%} CrI: 3.5, 5.9). Conclusions: The serial interval of COVID-19 is close to or shorter than its median incubation period. This suggests that a substantial proportion of secondary transmission may occur prior to illness onset. The COVID-19 serial interval is also shorter than the serial interval of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), indicating that calculations made using the SARS serial interval may introduce bias.},

The aim of this work is to provide the research community with comprehensive overview of the methods used in these studies as well as a compendium of available open source datasets in regards to COVID-19. In all, 61 journal articles, reports, fact sheets, and websites dealing with COVID-19 were studied and reviewed. It was found that most mathematical modeling done were based on the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) and Susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models while most of the AI implementations were Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on X-ray and CT images. In terms of available datasets, they include aggregated case reports, medical images, management strategies, healthcare workforce, demography, and mobility during the outbreak. Both Mathematical modeling and AI have both shown to be reliable tools in the fight against this pandemic. Several datasets concerning the COVID-19 have also been collected and shared open source. However, much work is needed to be done in the diversification of the datasets. Other AI and modeling applications in healthcare should be explored in regards to this COVID-19.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Long-term care facilities are high-risk settings for severe outcomes from outbreaks of Covid-19, owing to both the advanced age and frequent chronic underlying health conditions of the residents and the movement of health care personnel among facilities in a region. METHODS After identification on February 28, 2020, of a confirmed case of Covid-19 in a skilled nursing facility in King County, Washington, Public Health-Seattle and King County, aided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, launched a case investigation, contact tracing, quarantine of exposed persons, isolation of confirmed and suspected cases, and on-site enhancement of infection prevention and control. RESULTS As of March 18, a total of 167 confirmed cases of Covid-19 affecting 101 residents, 50 health care personnel, and 16 visitors were found to be epidemiologically linked to the facility. Most cases among residents included respiratory illness consistent with Covid-19; however, in 7 residents no symptoms were documented. Hospitalization rates for facility residents, visitors, and staff were 54.5{\%}, 50.0{\%}, and 6.0{\%}, respectively. The case fatality rate for residents was 33.7{\%} (34 of 101). As of March 18, a total of 30 long-term care facilities with at least one confirmed case of Covid-19 had been identified in King County. CONCLUSIONS In the context of rapidly escalating Covid-19 outbreaks, proactive steps by long-term care facilities to identify and exclude potentially infected staff and visitors, actively monitor for potentially infected patients, and implement appropriate infection prevention and control measures are needed to prevent the introduction of Covid-19.},

abstract = {Objectives The aim of this study was to conduct a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis of estimates of the incubation period of COVID-19. Design Rapid systematic review and meta-analysis of observational research. Setting International studies on incubation period of COVID-19. Participants Searches were carried out in PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, Cochrane Library as well as the preprint servers MedRxiv and BioRxiv. Studies were selected for meta-analysis if they reported either the parameters and CIs of the distributions fit to the data, or sufficient information to facilitate calculation of those values. After initial eligibility screening, 24 studies were selected for initial review, nine of these were shortlisted for meta-analysis. Final estimates are from meta-analysis of eight studies. Primary outcome measures Parameters of a lognormal distribution of incubation periods. Results The incubation period distribution may be modelled with a lognormal distribution with pooled mu and sigma parameters (95{\%} CIs) of 1.63 (95{\%} CI 1.51 to 1.75) and 0.50 (95{\%} CI 0.46 to 0.55), respectively. The corresponding mean (95{\%} CIs) was 5.8 (95{\%} CI 5.0 to 6.7) days. It should be noted that uncertainty increases towards the tail of the distribution: the pooled parameter estimates (95{\%} CIs) resulted in a median incubation period of 5.1 (95{\%} CI 4.5 to 5.8) days, whereas the 95th percentile was 11.7 (95{\%} CI 9.7 to 14.2) days. Conclusions The choice of which parameter values are adopted will depend on how the information is used, the associated risks and the perceived consequences of decisions to be taken. These recommendations will need to be revisited once further relevant information becomes available. Accordingly, we present an R Shiny app that facilitates updating these estimates as new data become available.},

abstract = {Background COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is a new, rapidly emerging zoonotic infectious disease, that was reported to the World Health Organization for the first time on 31 December 2019. Currently, no effective pharmacological interventions or vaccines are available to treat or prevent COVID-19, therefore nonpharmacological public health measures are more in focus. Objectives The aim was to assess the effects of quarantine - alone or in combination with other measures - during coronavirus outbreaks. Methods Because of the current COVID-19 pandemic, WHO commissioned a rapid review. To save time, the method of systematic reviews was slightly and with caution modified. This publication is a summary of the most important aspects of the rapid review, translated into German by members of the WHO Collaborating Centre at the Danube University Krems (Austria). Results Overall, 29 studies were included. Ten modeling studies focused on COVID-19, 4 observational studies and 15 modeling studies focused on SARS and MERS. The modeling studies consistently reported a benefit of the simulated quarantine measures. For example, the models estimated that quarantine of people exposed to confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 prevented between 44 and 81{\%} of the cases that would otherwise have happened and 31 to 63{\%} of the deaths, when compared to no such measures. In regard to costs, the earlier the quarantine measures are implemented, the greater the cost savings will be. Conclusion Our confidence in the evidence is very limited. This is mainly because the COVID-19 studies based their models on the limited data that have been available in the early weeks of the pandemic and made different assumptions about the virus. The studies of SARS and MERS are not completely generalizable to COVID-19. Despite only having limited evidence, all the studies found quarantine to be important for controlling the spread of severe coronavirus diseases. Looking to the coming months, in order to maintain the best possible balance of measures, decision makers must continue to constantly monitor the outbreak situation and the impact of the measures they implement.},

DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis on Connecticut nursing home (n = 215) COVID-19 report, linked to other nursing home files and county counts of confirmed cases and deaths. Multivariable two-part models determined the associations of key nursing home characteristics with the likelihood of at least one confirmed case (or death) in the facility, and with the count of cases (deaths) among facilities with at least one confirmed case (death). SETTING: All Connecticut nursing homes (n = 215). PARTICIPANTS: None. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS: Numbers of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths among residents. RESULTS: The average number of confirmed cases was eight per nursing home (zero in 107 facilities), and the average number of confirmed deaths was 1.7 per nursing home (zero in 131 facilities). Among facilities with at least one confirmed case, every 20-minute increase in RN staffing (per resident day) was associated with 22{\%} fewer confirmed cases (incidence rate ratio [IRR] =.78; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] =.68–.89; P {\textless}.001); compared with one- to three-star facilities, four- or five-star facilities had 13{\%} fewer confirmed cases (IRR =.87; 95{\%} CI =.78–.97; P {\textless}.015), and facilities with high concentration of Medicaid residents (IRR = 1.16; 95{\%} CI = 1.02–1.32; P =.025) or racial/ethnic minority residents (IRR = 1.15; 95{\%} CI = 1.03–1.29; P =.026) had 16{\%} and 15{\%} more confirmed cases, respectively, than their counterparts. Among facilities with at least one death, every 20-minute increase in RN staffing significantly predicted 26{\%} fewer COVID-19 deaths (IRR =.74; 95{\%} CI = I.55–1.00; P =.047). Other focused characteristics did not show statistically significant associations with deaths. CONCLUSION: Nursing homes with higher RN staffing and quality ratings have the potential to better control the spread of the novel coronavirus and reduce deaths. Nursing homes caring predominantly for Medicaid or racial and ethnic minority residents tend to have more confirmed cases.},

abstract = {Background: A novel human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in China in December 2019. There is limited support for many of its key epidemiologic features, including the incubation period for clinical disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]), which has important implications for surveillance and control activities. Objective: To estimate the length of the incubation period of COVID-19 and describe its public health implications. Design: Pooled analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between 4 January 2020 and 24 February 2020. Setting: News reports and press releases from 50 provinces, regions, and countries outside Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Participants: Persons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection outside Hubei province, China. Measurements: Patient demographic characteristics and dates and times of possible exposure, symptom onset, fever onset, and hospitalization. Results: There were 181 confirmed cases with identifiable exposure and symptom onset windows to estimate the incubation period of COVID-19. The median incubation period was estimated to be 5.1 days (95{\%} CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days), and 97.5{\%} of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days) of infection. These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 101 out of every 10 000 cases (99th percentile, 482) will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine. Limitation: Publicly reported cases may overrepresent severe cases, the incubation period for which may differ from that of mild cases. Conclusion: This work provides additional evidence for a median incubation period for COVID-19 of approximately 5 days, similar to SARS. Our results support current proposals for the length of quarantine or active monitoring of persons potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2, although longer monitoring periods might be justified in extreme cases.

We used estimates of seasonality, immunity, and cross-immunity for human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and HCoV-HKU1 using time-series data from the United States to inform a model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We projected that recurrent wintertime outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 will probably occur after the initial, most severe pandemic wave. Absent other interventions, a key metric for the success of social distancing is whether critical care capacities are exceeded. To avoid this, prolonged or intermittent social distancing may be necessary into 2022. Additional interventions, including expanded critical care capacity and an effective therapeutic, would improve the success of intermittent distancing and hasten the acquisition of herd immunity. Longitudinal serological studies are urgently needed to determine the extent and duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Even in the event of apparent elimination, SARS-CoV-2 surveillance should be maintained because a resurgence in contagion could be possible as late as 2024.},

abstract = {In this paper we develop a mathematical model for the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is a new $\theta$-SEIHRD model (not a SIR, SEIR or other general purpose model), which takes into account the known special characteristics of this disease, as the existence of infectious undetected cases and the different sanitary and infectiousness conditions of hospitalized people. In particular, it includes a novel approach that considers the fraction $\theta$ of detected cases over the real total infected cases, which allows to study the importance of this ratio on the impact of COVID-19. The model is also able to estimate the needs of beds in hospitals. It is complex enough to capture the most important effects, but also simple enough to allow an affordable identification of its parameters, using the data that authorities report on this pandemic. We study the particular case of China (including Chinese Mainland, Macao, Hong-Kong and Taiwan, as done by the World Health Organization in its reports on COVID-19), the country spreading the disease, and use its reported data to identify the model parameters, which can be of interest for estimating the spread of COVID-19 in other countries. We show a good agreement between the reported data and the estimations given by our model. We also study the behavior of the outputs returned by our model when considering incomplete reported data (by truncating them at some dates before and after the peak of daily reported cases). By comparing those results, we can estimate the error produced by the model when identifying the parameters at early stages of the pandemic. Finally, taking into account the advantages of the novelties introduced by our model, we study different scenarios to show how different values of the percentage of detected cases would have changed the global magnitude of COVID-19 in China, which can be of interest for policy makers.},

abstract = {In the United States, 1.4 million nursing home residents have been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic with at least 25,923 resident and 449 staff deaths reported from the virus by June 1, 2020. The majority of residents have chronic illnesses and conditions and are vulnerable to infections and many share rooms and have congregate meals. There was evidence of inadequate registered nurse (RN) staffing levels and infection control procedures in many nursing homes prior to the outbreak of the virus. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship of nurse staffing in California nursing homes and compare homes with and without COVID-19 residents. Study data were from both the California and Los Angeles Departments of Public Health and as well as news organizations on nursing homes reporting COVID-19 infections between March and May 4, 2020. Results indicate that nursing homes with total RN staffing levels under the recommended minimum standard (0.75 hours per resident day) had a two times greater probability of having COVID-19 resident infections. Nursing homes with lower Medicare five-star ratings on total nurse and RN staffing levels (adjusted for acuity), higher total health deficiencies, and more beds had a higher probability of having COVID-19 residents. Nursing homes with low RN and total staffing levels appear to leave residents vulnerable to COVID-19 infections. Establishing minimum staffing standards at the federal and state levels could prevent this in the future.},

We sought to understand whether baseline nurse staffing is associated with the presence of COVID-19 in nursing homes and whether staffing impacts outbreak severity. DESIGN: We analyzed Centers for Medicare {\&} Medicaid Services (CMS) facility-level data on COVID-19 cases and deaths merged with nursing home and county characteristics. We used logistic regressions to examine the associations of staffing levels from Nursing Home Compare with the outcomes of any COVID-19 cases and, conditional on at least one case, an outbreak. Among facilities with at least one case, we modeled count of deaths using hurdle negative binomial-2 regressions. SETTING: All nursing homes in the CMS COVID-19 Nursing Home Dataset with reports that passed the CMS Quality Assurance Check as of June 25, 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Residents of nursing homes that met COVID-19 reporting requirements. MEASUREMENTS: A nursing home is defined as having at least one case is if one or more confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case among residents or staff is reported. Conditional on at least one case, we examine two outcomes: an outbreak, defined as confirmed cases/certified beds {\textgreater}10{\%} or total confirmed and suspected cases/beds {\textgreater}20{\%} or {\textgreater}10 deaths, and the total number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 among residents and staff. RESULTS: A total of 71{\%} of the 13,167 nursing homes that reported COVID-19 data as of June 14 had at least one case among residents and/or staff. Of those, 27{\%} experienced an outbreak. Higher registered nurse-hours are associated with a higher probability of experiencing any cases. However, among facilities with at least one case, higher nurse aide (NA) hours and total nursing hours are associated with a lower probability of experiencing an outbreak and with fewer deaths. The strongest predictor of cases and outbreaks in nursing homes is per capita cases in the county. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of COVID-19 in the community remains the strongest predictor of COVID-19 cases and deaths in nursing homes, but higher NA hours and total nursing hours may help contain the number of cases and deaths.},

@article{Gaudou2020,
abstract = {Since its emergence in China, the COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly around the world. Faced with this unknown disease, public health authorities were forced to experiment, in a short period of time, with various combinations of interventions at different scales. However, as the pandemic progresses, there is an urgent need for tools and methodologies to quickly analyze the effectiveness of responses against COVID-19 in different communities and contexts. In this perspective, computer modeling appears to be an invaluable lever as it allows for the in silico exploration of a range of intervention strategies prior to the potential field implementation phase. More specifically, we argue that, in order to take into account important dimensions of policy actions, such as the heterogeneity of the individual response or the spatial aspect of containment strategies, the branch of computer modeling known as agent-based modeling is of immense interest. We present in this paper an agent-based modeling framework called COVID-19 Modeling Kit (COMOKIT), designed to be generic, scalable and thus portable in a variety of social and geographical contexts. COMOKIT combines models of person-to-person and environmental transmission, a model of individual epidemiological status evolution, an agenda-based 1-h time step model of human mobility, and an intervention model. It is designed to be modular and flexible enough to allow modelers and users to represent different strategies and study their impacts in multiple social, epidemiological or economic scenarios. Several large-scale experiments are analyzed in this paper and allow us to show the potentialities of COMOKIT in terms of analysis and comparison of the impacts of public health policies in a realistic case study.},

abstract = {We have applied mathematical modeling to investigate the infections of the ongoing coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus. We first validated our model using the well-studied influenza viruses and then compared the pathogenesis processes between the two viruses. The interaction between host innate and adaptive immune responses was found to be a potential cause for the higher severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Specifically, the timing mismatch between the two immune responses has a major impact on disease progression. The adaptive immune response of the COVID-19 patients is more likely to come before the peak of viral load, while the opposite is true for influenza patients. This difference in timing causes delayed depletion of vulnerable epithelial cells in the lungs in COVID-19 patients while enhancing viral clearance in influenza patients. Stronger adaptive immunity in COVID-19 patients can potentially lead to longer recovery time and more severe secondary complications. Based on our analysis, delaying the onset of adaptive immune responses during the early phase of infections may be a potential treatment option for high-risk COVID-19 patients. Suppressing the adaptive immune response temporarily and avoiding its interference with the innate immune response may allow the innate immunity to more efficiently clear the virus.},

abstract = {Nursing homes and other long term-care facilities account for a disproportionate share of COVID-19 cases and fatalities worldwide. Outbreaks in U.S. nursing homes have persisted despite nationwide visitor restrictions beginning in mid-March. An early report issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified staff members working in multiple nursing homes as a likely source of spread from the Life Care Center in Kirkland, Washington to other skilled nursing facilities. The full extent of staff connections between nursing homes---and the crucial role these connections serve in spreading a highly contagious respiratory infection---is currently unknown given the lack of centralized data on cross-facility nursing home employment. In this paper, we perform the first large-scale analysis of nursing home connections via shared staff using device-level geolocation data from 30 million smartphones, and find that 7 percent of smartphones appearing in a nursing home also appeared in at least one other facility---even after visitor restrictions were imposed. We construct network measures of nursing home connectedness and estimate that nursing homes have, on average, connections with 15 other facilities. Controlling for demographic and other factors, a home's staff-network connections and its centrality within the greater network strongly predict COVID-19 cases. Traditional federal regulatory metrics of nursing home quality are unimportant in predicting outbreaks, consistent with recent research. Results suggest that eliminating staff linkages between nursing homes could reduce COVID-19 infections in nursing homes by 44 percent.},

abstract = {Importance: Nursing home residents have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 epidemic. Prevention recommendations have emphasized frequent testing of healthcare personnel and residents, but additional strategies are needed to protect nursing home residents. Objective: We developed a reproducible index of nursing home crowding and determined whether crowding was associated with incidence of COVID-19 in the first months of the COVID-19 epidemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: Population-based retrospective cohort study of over 78,000 residents of 618 distinct nursing homes in Ontario, Canada from March 29 to May 20, 2020. Exposure: The nursing home crowding index equalled the average number of residents per bedroom and bathroom. Outcomes: Primary outcomes included the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 infection and mortality, per 100 residents; introduction of COVID-19 into a home ({\textgreater}=1 resident case) was a negative tracer. Results: Of 623 homes in Ontario, we obtained complete information on 618 homes (99{\%}) housing 78,607 residents. A total of 5,218 residents (6.6{\%}) developed COVID-19 infection, and 1,452 (1.8{\%}) died with COVID-19 infection as of May 20, 2020. COVID-19 infection was distributed unevenly across nursing homes: 4,496 (86{\%}) of infections occurred in just 63 (10{\%}) of homes. The crowding index ranged across homes from 1.3 (mainly single-occupancy rooms) to 4.0 (exclusively quadruple occupancy rooms); 308 (50{\%}) homes had high crowding index ({\textgreater}=2). Incidence in high crowding index homes was 9.7{\%}, versus 4.5{\%} in low crowding index homes (p{\textless}0.001), while COVID-19 mortality was 2.7{\%}, versus 1.3{\%}. The likelihood of COVID-19 introduction did not differ (31.3{\%} vs 30.2{\%}, p=0.79). After adjustment for regional, nursing home, and resident covariates, the crowding index remained associated with increased risk of infection (RR=1.72, 95{\%} Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.11-2.65) and mortality (RR=1.72, 95{\%}CI: 1.03-2.86). Propensity score analysis yielded similar conclusions for infection (RR=2.06, 95{\%}CI: 1.34-3.17) and mortality (RR=2.09, 95{\%}CI: 1.30-3.38). Simulations suggested that converting all 4-bed rooms to 2-bed rooms would have averted 988 (18.9{\%}) infections of COVID-19 and 271 (18.7{\%}) deaths. Conclusions and Relevance: Crowding was associated with higher incidence of COVID-19 infection and mortality. Reducing crowding in nursing homes could prevent future COVID-19 mortality. {\#}{\#}{\#} Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. {\#}{\#}{\#} Funding Statement No external funding was received for this work {\#}{\#}{\#} Author Declarations I confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.

On average, 6.41{\%} of personal care and nursing aides and 6.23{\%} of licensed practical nurses and registered nurses hold second jobs; second job holding rates are 35{\%} and 32{\%} higher than those of other workers, respectively. Both wages and hours in the primary job are negatively associated with the probability of holding a second job for personal care and nursing aides, while lower hours are more strongly correlated with a second job for registered nurses and licensed practical nurses. Many of these workers move across health settings from their first to second jobs, and 15{\%} of second jobs for personal care and nursing aides are in other "essential" occupations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been documented in a large share of nursing homes throughout the United States, leading to high rates of mortality for residents. To understand how to prevent and mitigate future outbreaks, it is imperative that we understand which nursing homes are more likely to experience COVID-19 cases. Our aim was to examine the characteristics of nursing homes with documented COVID-19 cases in the 30 states reporting the individual facilities affected. DESIGN: We constructed a database of nursing homes with verified COVID-19 cases as of May 11, 2020, via correspondence with and publicly available reports from state departments of health. We linked this information to nursing home characteristics and used regression analysis to examine the association between these characteristics and the likelihood of having a documented COVID-19 case. SETTING: All nursing homes from 30 states that reported COVID-19 cases at the facility-level. PARTICIPANTS: Nursing home residents in states reporting data. MEASUREMENTS: Whether a nursing home had a reported COVID-19 case (yes/no), and conditional on having a case, the number of cases at a nursing home. RESULTS: Of 9,395 nursing homes in our sample, 2,949 (31.4{\%}) had a documented COVID-19 case. Larger facility size, urban location, greater percentage of African American residents, non-chain status, and state were significantly (P {\textless}.05) related to the increased probability of having a COVID-19 case. Five-star rating, prior infection violation, Medicaid dependency, and ownership were not significantly related.

abstract = { Background: Interventions are now in place worldwide to reduce transmission of the novel coronavirus. Assessing temporal variations in transmission in different countries is essential for evaluating the effectiveness of public health interventions and the impact of changes in policy.  Methods: We use case notification data to generate daily estimates of the time-dependent reproduction number in different regions and countries. Our modelling framework, based on open source tooling, accounts for reporting delays, so that temporal variations in reproduction number estimates can be compared directly with the times at which interventions are implemented.  Results: We provide three example uses of our framework. First, we demonstrate how the toolset displays temporal changes in the reproduction number. Second, we show how the framework can be used to reconstruct case counts by date of infection from case counts by date of notification, as well as to estimate the reproduction number. Third, we show how maps can be generated to clearly show if case numbers are likely to decrease or increase in different regions. Results are shown for regions and countries worldwide on our website ( https://epiforecasts.io/covid/ ) and are updated daily. Our tooling is provided as an open-source R package to allow replication by others.  Conclusions: This decision-support tool can be used to assess changes in virus transmission in different regions and countries worldwide. This allows policymakers to assess the effectiveness of current interventions, and will be useful for inferring whether or not transmission will increase when interventions are lifted. As well as providing daily updates on our website, we also provide adaptable computing code so that our approach can be used directly by researchers and policymakers on confidential datasets. We hope that our tool will be used to support decisions in countries worldwide throughout the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. },
