It is a new θ-SEIHRD model (not a SIR, SEIR or other general purpose model), which takes into account the known special characteristics of this disease, as the existence of infectious undetected cases and the different sanitary and infectiousness conditions of hospitalized people. In particular, it includes a novel approach that considers the fraction θ of detected cases over the real total infected cases, which allows to study the importance of this ratio on the impact of COVID-19. The model is also able to estimate the needs of beds in hospitals. It is complex enough to capture the most important effects, but also simple enough to allow an affordable identification of its parameters, using the data that authorities report on this pandemic. We study the particular case of China (including Chinese Mainland, Macao, Hong-Kong and Taiwan, as done by the World Health Organization in its reports on COVID-19), the country spreading the disease, and use its reported data to identify the model parameters, which can be of interest for estimating the spread of COVID-19 in other countries. We show a good agreement between the reported data and the estimations given by our model. We also study the behavior of the outputs returned by our model when considering incomplete reported data (by truncating them at some dates before and after the peak of daily reported cases). By comparing those results, we can estimate the error produced by the model when identifying the parameters at early stages of the pandemic. Finally, taking into account the advantages of the novelties introduced by our model, we study different scenarios to show how different values of the percentage of detected cases would have changed the global magnitude of COVID-19 in China, which can be of interest for policy makers.</abstract></record><record><database name="References.enl" path="References.enl">References.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kim, Arthur Y</author><author>Gandhi, Rajesh T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reinfection With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2: What Goes Around May Come Back Around</title><secondary-title>Clinical Infectious Diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Clinical Infectious Diseases</full-title></periodical><pages>1-4</pages><issue>Xx</issue><keywords><keyword>both after natural infec-</keyword><keyword>for example</keyword><keyword>protective immunity</keyword><keyword>reinfection</keyword><keyword>rna viruses</keyword><keyword>sars-cov-2</keyword><keyword>tion and after vaccination</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/cid/ciaa1541</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://ciaa1541.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="References.enl" path="References.enl">References.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nishiura, Hiroshi</author><author>Linton, Natalie M.</author><author>Akhmetzhanov, Andrei R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Serial interval of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Infectious Diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Infectious Diseases</full-title></periodical><pages>284-286</pages><volume>93</volume><keywords><keyword>Coronavirus</keyword><keyword>Epidemiology</keyword><keyword>Generation time</keyword><keyword>Illness onset</keyword><keyword>Outbreak</keyword><keyword>Statistical model</keyword><keyword>Viruses</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>International Society for Infectious Diseases</publisher><accession-num>32145466</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ijid.2020.02.060</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Nishiura, Linton, Akhmetzhanov - 2020 - Serial interval of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.02.060</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Objective: To estimate the serial interval of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from information on 28 infector-infectee pairs. Methods: We collected dates of illness onset for primary cases (infectors) and secondary cases (infectees) from published research articles and case investigation reports. We subjectively ranked the credibility of the data and performed analyses on both the full dataset (n = 28) and a subset of pairs with highest certainty in reporting (n = 18). In addition, we adjust for right truncation of the data as the epidemic is still in its growth phase. Results: Accounting for right truncation and analyzing all pairs, we estimated the median serial interval at 4.0 days (95% credible interval [CrI]: 3.1, 4.9). Limiting our data to only the most certain pairs, the median serial interval was estimated at 4.6 days (95% CrI: 3.5, 5.9). Conclusions: The serial interval of COVID-19 is close to or shorter than its median incubation period. This suggests that a substantial proportion of secondary transmission may occur prior to illness onset. The COVID-19 serial interval is also shorter than the serial interval of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), indicating that calculations made using the SARS serial interval may introduce bias.</abstract></record><record><database name="References.enl" path="References.enl">References.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Verity, Robert</author><author>Okell, Lucy C.</author><author>Dorigatti, Ilaria</author><author>Winskill, Peter</author><author>Whittaker, Charles</author><author>Imai, Natsuko</author><author>Cuomo-Dannenburg, Gina</author><author>Thompson, Hayley</author><author>Walker, Patrick G.T.</author><author>Fu, Han</author><author>Dighe, Amy</author><author>Griffin, Jamie T.</author><author>Baguelin, Marc</author><author>Bhatia, Sangeeta</author><author>Boonyasiri, Adhiratha</author><author>Cori, Anne</author><author>Cucunubá, Zulma</author><author>FitzJohn, Rich</author><author>Gaythorpe, Katy</author><author>Green, Will</author><author>Hamlet, Arran</author><author>Hinsley, Wes</author><author>Laydon, Daniel</author><author>Nedjati-Gilani, Gemma</author><author>Riley, Steven</author><author>van Elsland, Sabine</author><author>Volz, Erik</author><author>Wang, Haowei</author><author>Wang, Yuanrong</author><author>Xi, Xiaoyue</author><author>Donnelly, Christl A.</author><author>Ghani, Azra C.</author><author>Ferguson, Neil M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimates of the severity of coronavirus disease 2019: a model-based analysis</title><secondary-title>The Lancet Infectious Diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Lancet Infectious Diseases</full-title></periodical><pages>669-677</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32240634</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30243-7</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://PIIS1473309920302437.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Background: In the face of rapidly changing data, a range of case fatality ratio estimates for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude. We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases. Methods: We collected individual-case data for patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020). These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital). We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment. We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China. Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio. Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation. Findings: Using data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17·8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16·9–19·2) and to hospital discharge to be 24·7 days (22·9–28·1). In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70 117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3·67% (95% CrI 3·56–3·80). However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1·38% (1·23–1·53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0·32% [0·27–0·38] in those aged &lt;60 years vs 6·4% [5·7–7·2] in those aged ≥60 years), up to 13·4% (11·2–15·9) in those aged 80 years or older. Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1·4% [0·4–3·5] in those aged &lt;60 years [n=360] and 4·5% [1·8–11·1] in those aged ≥60 years [n=151]). Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0·66% (0·39–1·33), with an increasing profile with age. Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 18·4% (11·0–37·6) in those aged 80 years or older. Interpretation: These early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and show a strong age gradient in risk of death.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis on Connecticut nursing home (n = 215) COVID-19 report, linked to other nursing home files and county counts of confirmed cases and deaths. Multivariable two-part models determined the associations of key nursing home characteristics with the likelihood of at least one confirmed case (or death) in the facility, and with the count of cases (deaths) among facilities with at least one confirmed case (death). SETTING: All Connecticut nursing homes (n = 215). PARTICIPANTS: None. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS: Numbers of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths among residents. RESULTS: The average number of confirmed cases was eight per nursing home (zero in 107 facilities), and the average number of confirmed deaths was 1.7 per nursing home (zero in 131 facilities). Among facilities with at least one confirmed case, every 20-minute increase in RN staffing (per resident day) was associated with 22% fewer confirmed cases (incidence rate ratio [IRR] =.78; 95% confidence interval [CI] =.68–.89; P &lt;.001); compared with one- to three-star facilities, four- or five-star facilities had 13% fewer confirmed cases (IRR =.87; 95% CI =.78–.97; P &lt;.015), and facilities with high concentration of Medicaid residents (IRR = 1.16; 95% CI = 1.02–1.32; P =.025) or racial/ethnic minority residents (IRR = 1.15; 95% CI = 1.03–1.29; P =.026) had 16% and 15% more confirmed cases, respectively, than their counterparts. Among facilities with at least one death, every 20-minute increase in RN staffing significantly predicted 26% fewer COVID-19 deaths (IRR =.74; 95% CI = I.55–1.00; P =.047). Other focused characteristics did not show statistically significant associations with deaths. CONCLUSION: Nursing homes with higher RN staffing and quality ratings have the potential to better control the spread of the novel coronavirus and reduce deaths. Nursing homes caring predominantly for Medicaid or racial and ethnic minority residents tend to have more confirmed cases.</abstract></record><record><database name="References.enl" path="References.enl">References.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Plohl, Nejc</author><author>Musil, Bojan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modeling compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines: the critical role of trust in science</title><secondary-title>Psychology, Health and Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Psychology, Health and Medicine</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>COVID-19</keyword><keyword>COVID-19 prevention guidelines</keyword><keyword>adherence</keyword><keyword>compliance</keyword><keyword>predictors</keyword><keyword>trust in science</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32479113</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/13548506.2020.1772988</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>The coronavirus pandemic is one of the biggest health crises of our time. In response to this global problem, various institutions around the world had soon issued evidence-based prevention guidelines. However, these guidelines, which were designed to slow the spread of COVID-19 and contribute to public well-being, are (deliberately) disregarded by some individuals. In the present study, we aimed to develop and test a multivariate model that could help us identify individual characteristics that make a person more/less likely to comply with COVID-19 prevention guidelines. A total of 525 attentive participants completed the online survey. The results of structural equation modeling (SEM) show that COVID-19 risk perception and trust in science both independently predict compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines, while the remaining variables in the model (political conservatism, religious orthodoxy, conspiracy ideation and intellectual curiosity) do so via the mediating role of trust in science. The described model exhibited an acceptable fit (χ2(1611) = 2485.84, p &lt;.001, CFI =.91, RMSEA =.032, SRMR =.055). These findings thus provide empirical support for the proposed multivariate model and underline the importance of trust in science in explaining the different levels of compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines.</abstract></record><record><database name="References.enl" path="References.enl">References.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Abrams, Hannah R.</author><author>Loomer, Lacey</author><author>Gandhi, Ashvin</author><author>Grabowski, David C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Characteristics of U.S. Nursing Homes with COVID-19 Cases</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Geriatrics Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Geriatrics Society</full-title></periodical><pages>1653-1656</pages><volume>68</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>COVID-19</keyword><keyword>long-term care</keyword><keyword>nursing homes</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32484912</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jgs.16661</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://jgs.16661.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been documented in a large share of nursing homes throughout the United States, leading to high rates of mortality for residents. To understand how to prevent and mitigate future outbreaks, it is imperative that we understand which nursing homes are more likely to experience COVID-19 cases. Our aim was to examine the characteristics of nursing homes with documented COVID-19 cases in the 30 states reporting the individual facilities affected. DESIGN: We constructed a database of nursing homes with verified COVID-19 cases as of May 11, 2020, via correspondence with and publicly available reports from state departments of health. We linked this information to nursing home characteristics and used regression analysis to examine the association between these characteristics and the likelihood of having a documented COVID-19 case. SETTING: All nursing homes from 30 states that reported COVID-19 cases at the facility-level. PARTICIPANTS: Nursing home residents in states reporting data. MEASUREMENTS: Whether a nursing home had a reported COVID-19 case (yes/no), and conditional on having a case, the number of cases at a nursing home. RESULTS: Of 9,395 nursing homes in our sample, 2,949 (31.4%) had a documented COVID-19 case. Larger facility size, urban location, greater percentage of African American residents, non-chain status, and state were significantly (P &lt;.05) related to the increased probability of having a COVID-19 case. Five-star rating, prior infection violation, Medicaid dependency, and ownership were not significantly related. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 cases in nursing homes are related to facility location and size and not traditional quality metrics such as star rating and prior infection control citations.

We first validated our model using the well-studied influenza viruses and then compared the pathogenesis processes between the two viruses. The interaction between host innate and adaptive immune responses was found to be a potential cause for the higher severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Specifically, the timing mismatch between the two immune responses has a major impact on disease progression. The adaptive immune response of the COVID-19 patients is more likely to come before the peak of viral load, while the opposite is true for influenza patients. This difference in timing causes delayed depletion of vulnerable epithelial cells in the lungs in COVID-19 patients while enhancing viral clearance in influenza patients. Stronger adaptive immunity in COVID-19 patients can potentially lead to longer recovery time and more severe secondary complications. Based on our analysis, delaying the onset of adaptive immune responses during the early phase of infections may be a potential treatment option for high-risk COVID-19 patients. Suppressing the adaptive immune response temporarily and avoiding its interference with the innate immune response may allow the innate immunity to more efficiently clear the virus.</abstract></record><record><database name="References.enl" path="References.enl">References.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, M.

Outbreaks in U.S. nursing homes have persisted despite nationwide visitor restrictions beginning in mid-March. An early report issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified staff members working in multiple nursing homes as a likely source of spread from the Life Care Center in Kirkland, Washington to other skilled nursing facilities. The full extent of staff connections between nursing homes---and the crucial role these connections serve in spreading a highly contagious respiratory infection---is currently unknown given the lack of centralized data on cross-facility nursing home employment. In this paper, we perform the first large-scale analysis of nursing home connections via shared staff using device-level geolocation data from 30 million smartphones, and find that 7 percent of smartphones appearing in a nursing home also appeared in at least one other facility---even after visitor restrictions were imposed. We construct network measures of nursing home connectedness and estimate that nursing homes have, on average, connections with 15 other facilities. Controlling for demographic and other factors, a home's staff-network connections and its centrality within the greater network strongly predict COVID-19 cases. Traditional federal regulatory metrics of nursing home quality are unimportant in predicting outbreaks, consistent with recent research. Results suggest that eliminating staff linkages between nursing homes could reduce COVID-19 infections in nursing homes by 44 percent.</abstract></record><record><database name="References.enl" path="References.enl">References.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brown, Kevin</author><author>Jones, Aaron</author><author>Daneman, Nick</author><author>Chan, Adrienne</author><author>Schwartz, Kevin</author><author>Garber, Gary</author><author>Costa, Andrew</author><author>Stall, Nathan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Association Between Nursing Home Crowding and COVID-19 Infection and Mortality in Ontario, Canada</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>33165560</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.06.23.20137729</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2020.06.23.20137729v1.full.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Importance: Nursing home residents have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 epidemic. Prevention recommendations have emphasized frequent testing of healthcare personnel and residents, but additional strategies are needed to protect nursing home residents. Objective: We developed a reproducible index of nursing home crowding and determined whether crowding was associated with incidence of COVID-19 in the first months of the COVID-19 epidemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: Population-based retrospective cohort study of over 78,000 residents of 618 distinct nursing homes in Ontario, Canada from March 29 to May 20, 2020. Exposure: The nursing home crowding index equalled the average number of residents per bedroom and bathroom. Outcomes: Primary outcomes included the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 infection and mortality, per 100 residents; introduction of COVID-19 into a home (&gt;=1 resident case) was a negative tracer. Results: Of 623 homes in Ontario, we obtained complete information on 618 homes (99%) housing 78,607 residents. A total of 5,218 residents (6.6%) developed COVID-19 infection, and 1,452 (1.8%) died with COVID-19 infection as of May 20, 2020. COVID-19 infection was distributed unevenly across nursing homes: 4,496 (86%) of infections occurred in just 63 (10%) of homes. The crowding index ranged across homes from 1.3 (mainly single-occupancy rooms) to 4.0 (exclusively quadruple occupancy rooms); 308 (50%) homes had high crowding index (&gt;=2). Incidence in high crowding index homes was 9.7%, versus 4.5% in low crowding index homes (p&lt;0.001), while COVID-19 mortality was 2.7%, versus 1.3%. The likelihood of COVID-19 introduction did not differ (31.3% vs 30.2%, p=0.79). After adjustment for regional, nursing home, and resident covariates, the crowding index remained associated with increased risk of infection (RR=1.72, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.11-2.65) and mortality (RR=1.72, 95%CI: 1.03-2.86). Propensity score analysis yielded similar conclusions for infection (RR=2.06, 95%CI: 1.34-3.17) and mortality (RR=2.09, 95%CI: 1.30-3.38). Simulations suggested that converting all 4-bed rooms to 2-bed rooms would have averted 988 (18.9%) infections of COVID-19 and 271 (18.7%) deaths. Conclusions and Relevance: Crowding was associated with higher incidence of COVID-19 infection and mortality. Reducing crowding in nursing homes could prevent future COVID-19 mortality. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement No external funding was received for this work ### Author Declarations I confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.

METHODS After identification on February 28, 2020, of a confirmed case of Covid-19 in a skilled nursing facility in King County, Washington, Public Health-Seattle and King County, aided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, launched a case investigation, contact tracing, quarantine of exposed persons, isolation of confirmed and suspected cases, and on-site enhancement of infection prevention and control. RESULTS As of March 18, a total of 167 confirmed cases of Covid-19 affecting 101 residents, 50 health care personnel, and 16 visitors were found to be epidemiologically linked to the facility. Most cases among residents included respiratory illness consistent with Covid-19; however, in 7 residents no symptoms were documented. Hospitalization rates for facility residents, visitors, and staff were 54.5%, 50.0%, and 6.0%, respectively. The case fatality rate for residents was 33.7% (34 of 101). As of March 18, a total of 30 long-term care facilities with at least one confirmed case of Covid-19 had been identified in King County. CONCLUSIONS In the context of rapidly escalating Covid-19 outbreaks, proactive steps by long-term care facilities to identify and exclude potentially infected staff and visitors, actively monitor for potentially infected patients, and implement appropriate infection prevention and control measures are needed to prevent the introduction of Covid-19.</abstract></record><record><database name="References.enl" path="References.enl">References.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shi, Yufang</author><author>Wang, Ying</author><author>Shao, Changshun</author><author>Huang, Jianan</author><author>Gan, Jianhe</author><author>Huang, Xiaoping</author><author>Bucci, Enrico</author><author>Piacentini, Mauro</author><author>Ippolito, Giuseppe</author><author>Melino, Gerry</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>COVID-19 infection: the perspectives on immune responses</title><secondary-title>Cell Death and Differentiation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell Death and Differentiation</full-title></periodical><pages>1451-1454</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Springer US</publisher><accession-num>32205856</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41418-020-0530-3</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Shi et al. - 2020 - COVID-19 infection the perspectives on immune responses.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41418-020-0530-3</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="References.enl" path="References.enl">References.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>US Department of Health and Human Services, Center for Disease Control</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Preparing for COVID-19 in Nursing Homes</title></titles><periodical/><pages>1-8</pages><volume>2019</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://cdc_97611_DS1.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/long-term-care.html</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Tiered recommendations to address nursing homes in different phases of COVID-19 response Added a recommendation to assign an individual to manage the facility’s infection control program Added guidance about new requirements for nursing homes to report to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Added a recommendation to create a plan for testing residents and healthcare personnel for SARS-CoV-2</abstract></record><record><database name="References.enl" path="References.enl">References.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tang, Yuanji</author><author>Wang, Shixia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mathematic modeling of COVID-19 in the United States</title><secondary-title>Emerging Microbes &amp; Infections</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Emerging Microbes &amp; Infections</full-title></periodical><pages>827-829</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>COVID-19</keyword><keyword>SARS-CoV-2</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>modeling</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32338150</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/22221751.2020.1760146</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Tang, Wang - 2020 - Mathematic modeling of COVID-19 in the United States.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22221751.2020.1760146</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>COVID-19, the worst pandemic in 100 years, has rapidly spread to the entire world in 2 months since its early report in January 2020.

The prevalence of COVID-19 among older adults in independent/assisted living is not understood. Objectives: To conduct surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 and describe symptoms of COVID-19 among residents and staff of an independent/assisted living community. Design, Setting, and Participants: In March 2020, public health surveillance of staff and residents was conducted on site at an assisted and independent living residence for older adults in Seattle, Washington, after exposure to 2 residents who were hospitalized with COVID-19. Exposures: Surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a congregate setting implementing social isolation and infection prevention protocols. Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs from residents and staff; a symptom questionnaire was completed assessing fever, cough, and other symptoms for the preceding 14 days. Residents were retested for SARS-CoV-2 7 days after initial screening. Results: Testing was performed on 80 residents; 62 were women (77%), with mean age of 86 (range, 69-102) years. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 3 of 80 residents (3.8%); none felt ill, 1 male resident reported resolved cough and 1 loose stool during the preceding 14 days. Virus was also detected in 2 of 62 staff (3.2%); both were symptomatic. One week later, resident SARS-CoV-2 testing was repeated and 1 new infection detected (asymptomatic). All residents remained in isolation and were clinically stable 14 days after the second test. Conclusions and Relevance: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic residents highlights challenges in protecting older adults living in congregate settings. In this study, symptom screening failed to identify residents with infections and all 4 residents with SARS-CoV-2 remained asymptomatic after 14 days. Although 1 asymptomatic infection was found on retesting, a widespread facility outbreak was avoided. Compared with skilled nursing settings, in assisted/independent living communities, early surveillance to identify asymptomatic persons among residents and staff, in combination with adherence to recommended preventive strategies, may reduce viral spread..</abstract></record><record><database name="References.enl" path="References.enl">References.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gorges, Rebecca J.</author><author>Konetzka, Rita Tamara</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Staffing Levels and COVID-19 Cases and Outbreaks in U.S. Nursing Homes</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Geriatrics Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Geriatrics Society</full-title></periodical><pages>1-5</pages><keywords><keyword>COVID-19</keyword><keyword>long-term care</keyword><keyword>nursing homes</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32770832</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jgs.16787</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://jgs.16787.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Nursing homes have experienced a disproportionate share of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Early analyses indicated that baseline quality was not predictive of nursing home cases, but a more nuanced study of the role of nurse staffing is needed to target resources and better respond to future outbreaks. We sought to understand whether baseline nurse staffing is associated with the presence of COVID-19 in nursing homes and whether staffing impacts outbreak severity. DESIGN: We analyzed Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) facility-level data on COVID-19 cases and deaths merged with nursing home and county characteristics. We used logistic regressions to examine the associations of staffing levels from Nursing Home Compare with the outcomes of any COVID-19 cases and, conditional on at least one case, an outbreak. Among facilities with at least one case, we modeled count of deaths using hurdle negative binomial-2 regressions. SETTING: All nursing homes in the CMS COVID-19 Nursing Home Dataset with reports that passed the CMS Quality Assurance Check as of June 25, 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Residents of nursing homes that met COVID-19 reporting requirements. MEASUREMENTS: A nursing home is defined as having at least one case is if one or more confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case among residents or staff is reported. Conditional on at least one case, we examine two outcomes: an outbreak, defined as confirmed cases/certified beds &gt;10% or total confirmed and suspected cases/beds &gt;20% or &gt;10 deaths, and the total number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 among residents and staff. RESULTS: A total of 71% of the 13,167 nursing homes that reported COVID-19 data as of June 14 had at least one case among residents and/or staff. Of those, 27% experienced an outbreak. Higher registered nurse-hours are associated with a higher probability of experiencing any cases. However, among facilities with at least one case, higher nurse aide (NA) hours and total nursing hours are associated with a lower probability of experiencing an outbreak and with fewer deaths. The strongest predictor of cases and outbreaks in nursing homes is per capita cases in the county. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of COVID-19 in the community remains the strongest predictor of COVID-19 cases and deaths in nursing homes, but higher NA hours and total nursing hours may help contain the number of cases and deaths.</abstract></record><record><database name="References.enl" path="References.enl">References.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Edridge, Arthur W.D.</author><author>Kaczorowska, Joanna</author><author>Hoste, Alexis C.R.</author><author>Bakker, Margreet</author><author>Klein, Michelle</author><author>Loens, Katherine</author><author>Jebbink, Maarten F.</author><author>Matser, Amy</author><author>Kinsella, Cormac M.</author><author>Rueda, Paloma</author><author>Ieven, Margareta</author><author>Goossens, Herman</author><author>Prins, Maria</author><author>Sastre, Patricia</author><author>Deijs, Martin</author><author>van der Hoek, Lia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Seasonal coronavirus protective immunity is short-lasting</title><secondary-title>Nature Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1691-1693</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Springer US</publisher><accession-num>32929268</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41591-020-1083-1</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://s41591-020-1083-1.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-1083-1</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>A key unsolved question in the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the duration of acquired immunity.

We used estimates of seasonality, immunity, and cross-immunity for human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and HCoV-HKU1 using time-series data from the United States to inform a model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We projected that recurrent wintertime outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 will probably occur after the initial, most severe pandemic wave. Absent other interventions, a key metric for the success of social distancing is whether critical care capacities are exceeded. To avoid this, prolonged or intermittent social distancing may be necessary into 2022. Additional interventions, including expanded critical care capacity and an effective therapeutic, would improve the success of intermittent distancing and hasten the acquisition of herd immunity. Longitudinal serological studies are urgently needed to determine the extent and duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Even in the event of apparent elimination, SARS-CoV-2 surveillance should be maintained because a resurgence in contagion could be possible as late as 2024.</abstract></record><record><database name="References.enl" path="References.enl">References.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McAloon, Conor</author><author>Collins, Áine</author><author>Hunt, Kevin</author><author>Barber, Ann</author><author>Byrne, Andrew W.</author><author>Butler, Francis</author><author>Casey, Miriam</author><author>Griffin, John</author><author>Lane, Elizabeth</author><author>McEvoy, David</author><author>Wall, Patrick</author><author>Green, Martin</author><author>O'Grady, Luke</author><author>More, Simon J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Incubation period of COVID-19: A rapid systematic review and meta-analysis of observational research</title><secondary-title>BMJ Open</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMJ Open</full-title></periodical><pages>1-9</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>public health</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32801208</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/bmjopen-2020-039652</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://McAloon et al. - 2020 - Incubation period of COVID-19 A rapid systematic review and meta-analysis of observational research.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Objectives The aim of this study was to conduct a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis of estimates of the incubation period of COVID-19. Design Rapid systematic review and meta-analysis of observational research. Setting International studies on incubation period of COVID-19. Participants Searches were carried out in PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, Cochrane Library as well as the preprint servers MedRxiv and BioRxiv. Studies were selected for meta-analysis if they reported either the parameters and CIs of the distributions fit to the data, or sufficient information to facilitate calculation of those values. After initial eligibility screening, 24 studies were selected for initial review, nine of these were shortlisted for meta-analysis. Final estimates are from meta-analysis of eight studies. Primary outcome measures Parameters of a lognormal distribution of incubation periods. Results The incubation period distribution may be modelled with a lognormal distribution with pooled mu and sigma parameters (95% CIs) of 1.63 (95% CI 1.51 to 1.75) and 0.50 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.55), respectively. The corresponding mean (95% CIs) was 5.8 (95% CI 5.0 to 6.7) days. It should be noted that uncertainty increases towards the tail of the distribution: the pooled parameter estimates (95% CIs) resulted in a median incubation period of 5.1 (95% CI 4.5 to 5.8) days, whereas the 95th percentile was 11.7 (95% CI 9.7 to 14.2) days. Conclusions The choice of which parameter values are adopted will depend on how the information is used, the associated risks and the perceived consequences of decisions to be taken. These recommendations will need to be revisited once further relevant information becomes available. Accordingly, we present an R Shiny app that facilitates updating these estimates as new data become available.</abstract></record><record><database name="References.enl" path="References.enl">References.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gaudou, Benoit</author><author>Huynh, Nghi Quang</author><author>Philippon, Damien</author><author>Brugière, Arthur</author><author>Chapuis, Kevin</author><author>Taillandier, Patrick</author><author>Larmande, Pierre</author><author>Drogoul, Alexis</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>COMOKIT: A Modeling Kit to Understand, Analyze, and Compare the Impacts of Mitigation Policies Against the COVID-19 Epidemic at the Scale of a City</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Public Health</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Public Health</full-title></periodical><pages>1-18</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>September</issue><keywords><keyword>COVID-19</keyword><keyword>GAMA platform</keyword><keyword>agent-based modeling (ABM)</keyword><keyword>computer simulation (CS)</keyword><keyword>epidemiological modeling</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fpubh.2020.563247</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Gaudou et al. - 2020 - COMOKIT A Modeling Kit to Understand, Analyze, and Compare the Impacts of Mitigation Policies Against the COVID-1.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Since its emergence in China, the COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly around the world. Faced with this unknown disease, public health authorities were forced to experiment, in a short period of time, with various combinations of interventions at different scales. However, as the pandemic progresses, there is an urgent need for tools and methodologies to quickly analyze the effectiveness of responses against COVID-19 in different communities and contexts. In this perspective, computer modeling appears to be an invaluable lever as it allows for the in silico exploration of a range of intervention strategies prior to the potential field implementation phase. More specifically, we argue that, in order to take into account important dimensions of policy actions, such as the heterogeneity of the individual response or the spatial aspect of containment strategies, the branch of computer modeling known as agent-based modeling is of immense interest. We present in this paper an agent-based modeling framework called COVID-19 Modeling Kit (COMOKIT), designed to be generic, scalable and thus portable in a variety of social and geographical contexts. COMOKIT combines models of person-to-person and environmental transmission, a model of individual epidemiological status evolution, an agenda-based 1-h time step model of human mobility, and an intervention model. It is designed to be modular and flexible enough to allow modelers and users to represent different strategies and study their impacts in multiple social, epidemiological or economic scenarios. Several large-scale experiments are analyzed in this paper and allow us to show the potentialities of COMOKIT in terms of analysis and comparison of the impacts of public health policies in a realistic case study.</abstract></record><record><database name="References.enl" path="References.enl">References.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pang, Junxiong</author><author>Tan, Huei Nuo</author><author>Mak, Tze Minn</author><author>Octavia, Sophie</author><author>Maurer-stroh, Sebastian</author><author>Sirota, Fernanda L</author><author>Peng, Mark</author><author>Chan, Chew</author><author>Yi, Ian</author><author>Leong, Onn</author><author>Koh, Valerie T J</author><author>Lim, Peng</author><author>Vasoo, Shawn</author><author>Fisher, Dale</author><author>Cui, Lin</author><author>Rafman, Heidi</author><author>Cutter, Jeffery</author><author>Lee, Vernon J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A COVID-19 nursing home cluster linked to a household transmission: An epidemiological, clinical and phylogenetic investigation.</title></titles><periodical/><keywords><keyword>3724260</keyword><keyword>abstract</keyword><keyword>com</keyword><keyword>covid-19 epidemiology</keyword><keyword>electronic copy available at</keyword><keyword>has not been peer</keyword><keyword>household transmission</keyword><keyword>https</keyword><keyword>nursing home outbreak</keyword><keyword>phylogenetic tree</keyword><keyword>reviewed</keyword><keyword>sequencing</keyword><keyword>ssrn</keyword><keyword>this preprint research paper</keyword><keyword>whole genome</keyword></keywords><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://SSRN-id3724260.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="References.enl" path="References.enl">References.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Baughman, Reagan A</author><author>Stanley, Bryce</author><author>Smith, Kristin E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Second Job Holding Among Direct Care Workers and Nurses: Implications for COVID-19 Transmission in Long-Term Care.</title><secondary-title>Medical care research and review : MCRR</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Medical care research and review : MCRR</full-title></periodical><pages>1077558720974129</pages><keywords><keyword>covid-19</keyword><keyword>long-term care</keyword><keyword>nursing homes</keyword><keyword>second job holding</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>33213282</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/1077558720974129</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://1077558720974129.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33213282</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>One reason that nursing homes are a primary source of COVID-19 infections and deaths in the United States may be that workers hold multiple jobs. We use 2010-2019 Current Population Survey data to document the rate of second jobholding among nursing and long-term care workers. On average, 6.41% of personal care and nursing aides and 6.23% of licensed practical nurses and registered nurses hold second jobs; second job holding rates are 35% and 32% higher than those of other workers, respectively. Both wages and hours in the primary job are negatively associated with the probability of holding a second job for personal care and nursing aides, while lower hours are more strongly correlated with a second job for registered nurses and licensed practical nurses. Many of these workers move across health settings from their first to second jobs, and 15% of second jobs for personal care and nursing aides are in other &quot;essential&quot; occupations.</abstract></record><record><database name="References.enl" path="References.enl">References.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Escobar, Daniel J</author><author>Lanzi, Maria</author><author>Saberi, Pouné</author><author>Love, Ruby</author><author>Linkin, Darren R</author><author>Kelly, John J</author><author>Jhala, Darshana</author><author>Amorosa, Valerianna</author><author>Hofmann, Mary</author><author>Doyon, Jeffrey B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mitigation of a Coronavirus Disease 2019 Outbreak in a Nursing Home Through Serial Testing of Residents and Staff</title><secondary-title>Clinical Infectious Diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Clinical Infectious Diseases</full-title></periodical><pages>2019-2021</pages><issue>Xx Xxxx</issue><keywords><keyword>covid-19</keyword><keyword>nursing home</keyword><keyword>outbreak response</keyword><keyword>sars-cov-2</keyword><keyword>universal testing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/cid/ciaa1021</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://ciaa1021.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Nursing homes and long-term care facilities represent highly vulnerable environments for respiratory disease outbreaks, such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

We conducted a systematic review of the published literature and preprints on the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak following predefined eligibility criteria. Of 317 research articles generated from our initial search on PubMed and preprint archives on 21 February 2020, 41 met our inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Current evidence suggests that it takes about 3-7 days for the epidemic to double in size. Of 21 estimates for the basic reproduction number ranging from 1.9 to 6.5, 13 were between 2.0 and 3.0. The incubation period was estimated to be 4-6 days, whereas the serial interval was estimated to be 4-8 days. Though the true case fatality risk is yet unknown, current model-based estimates ranged from 0.3% to 1.4% for outside China. There is an urgent need for rigorous research focusing on the mitigation efforts to minimize the impact on society.</abstract></record><record><database name="References.enl" path="References.enl">References.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Davidson, Patricia M.</author><author>Szanton, Sarah L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Nursing homes and COVID-19: We can and should do better</title><secondary-title>Journal of Clinical Nursing</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Clinical Nursing</full-title></periodical><pages>2758-2759</pages><volume>29</volume><issue>15-16</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32281165</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jocn.15297</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://jocn.15297.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="References.enl" path="References.enl">References.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Aleta, Alberto</author><author>Martín-Corral, David</author><author>Pastore y Piontti, Ana</author><author>Ajelli, Marco</author><author>Litvinova, Maria</author><author>Chinazzi, Matteo</author><author>Dean, Natalie E.</author><author>Halloran, M.

Here we integrate anonymized, geolocalized mobility data with census and demographic data to build a detailed agent-based model of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission in the Boston metropolitan area. We find that a period of strict social distancing followed by a robust level of testing, contact-tracing and household quarantine could keep the disease within the capacity of the healthcare system while enabling the reopening of economic activities. Our results show that a response system based on enhanced testing and contact tracing can have a major role in relaxing social-distancing interventions in the absence of herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2.</abstract></record><record><database name="References.enl" path="References.enl">References.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Singhal, Tanu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Review of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19)</title><secondary-title>Indian Journal of Pediatrics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Indian Journal of Pediatrics</full-title></periodical><pages>281-286</pages><volume>87</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>2019-nCOV</keyword><keyword>COVID-19</keyword><keyword>Pneumonia</keyword><keyword>Review</keyword><keyword>SARS-CoV-2</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>The Indian Journal of Pediatrics</publisher><accession-num>32166607</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s12098-020-03263-6</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Singhal - 2020 - A Review of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19).pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>There is a new public health crises threatening the world with the emergence and spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) or the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus originated in bats and was transmitted to humans through yet unknown intermediary animals in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in December 2019. There have been around 96,000 reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and 3300 reported deaths to date (05/03/2020). The disease is transmitted by inhalation or contact with infected droplets and the incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 d. The symptoms are usually fever, cough, sore throat, breathlessness, fatigue, malaise among others. The disease is mild in most people; in some (usually the elderly and those with comorbidities), it may progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi organ dysfunction. Many people are asymptomatic. The case fatality rate is estimated to range from 2 to 3%. Diagnosis is by demonstration of the virus in respiratory secretions by special molecular tests. Common laboratory findings include normal/ low white cell counts with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). The computerized tomographic chest scan is usually abnormal even in those with no symptoms or mild disease. Treatment is essentially supportive; role of antiviral agents is yet to be established. Prevention entails home isolation of suspected cases and those with mild illnesses and strict infection control measures at hospitals that include contact and droplet precautions. The virus spreads faster than its two ancestors the SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), but has lower fatality. The global impact of this new epidemic is yet uncertain.</abstract></record><record><database name="References.enl" path="References.enl">References.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Almagor, Jonatan</author><author>Picascia, Stefano</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Can the app contain the spread?

Using an agent-based model, we explore one of the technology-based strategies proposed, a contact-tracing smartphone app. The model simulates the spread of COVID-19 in a population of agents on an urban scale. Agents are heterogeneous in their characteristics and are linked in a multi-layered network representing the social structure - including households, friendships, employment and schools. We explore the interplay of various adoption rates of the contact-tracing app, different levels of testing capacity, and behavioural factors, to assess the ability of this track-and-trace strategy to mitigate the epidemic. Results suggest that the app can contribute substantially to the reduction of infections in the population, although complete suppression of the virus is unlikely to be achieved. The model also shows that, while adopting the app is beneficial for epidemic control in most cases, a high adoption rate is likely to generate an extensive increase in the demand for testing, which, if not met with adequate supply, may render the app counterproductive. This points to the crucial role of an efficient testing policy and the necessity to upscale testing capacity.</abstract></record><record><database name="References.enl" path="References.enl">References.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mohamadou, Youssoufa</author><author>Halidou, Aminou</author><author>Kapen, Pascalin Tiam</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A review of mathematical modeling, artificial intelligence and datasets used in the study, prediction and management of COVID-19</title><secondary-title>Applied Intelligence</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Applied Intelligence</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Artificial intelligence</keyword><keyword>COVID-19</keyword><keyword>Corona virus</keyword><keyword>Mathematical modeling</keyword><keyword>Open source dataset</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10489-020-01770-9</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>In the past few months, several works were published in regards to the dynamics and early detection of COVID-19 via mathematical modeling and Artificial intelligence (AI). The aim of this work is to provide the research community with comprehensive overview of the methods used in these studies as well as a compendium of available open source datasets in regards to COVID-19. In all, 61 journal articles, reports, fact sheets, and websites dealing with COVID-19 were studied and reviewed. It was found that most mathematical modeling done were based on the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) and Susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models while most of the AI implementations were Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on X-ray and CT images. In terms of available datasets, they include aggregated case reports, medical images, management strategies, healthcare workforce, demography, and mobility during the outbreak. Both Mathematical modeling and AI have both shown to be reliable tools in the fight against this pandemic. Several datasets concerning the COVID-19 have also been collected and shared open source. However, much work is needed to be done in the diversification of the datasets. Other AI and modeling applications in healthcare should be explored in regards to this COVID-19.</abstract></record><record><database name="References.enl" path="References.enl">References.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Voysey, Merryn</author><author>Clemens, Sue Ann Costa</author><author>Madhi, Shabir A</author><author>Weckx, Lily Y</author><author>Folegatti, Pedro M</author><author>Aley, Parvinder K</author><author>Angus, Brian</author><author>Baillie, Vicky L</author><author>Barnabas, Shaun L</author><author>Bhorat, Qasim E</author><author>Bibi, Sagida</author><author>Briner, Carmen</author><author>Cicconi, Paola</author><author>Collins, Andrea M</author><author>Colin-Jones, Rachel</author><author>Cutland, Clare L</author><author>Darton, Thomas C</author><author>Dheda, Keertan</author><author>Duncan, Christopher J A</author><author>Emary, Katherine R W</author><author>Ewer, Katie J</author><author>Fairlie, Lee</author><author>Faust, Saul N</author><author>Feng, Shuo</author><author>Ferreira, Daniela M</author><author>Finn, Adam</author><author>Goodman, Anna L</author><author>Green, Catherine M</author><author>Green, Christopher A</author><author>Heath, Paul T</author><author>Hill, Catherine</author><author>Hill, Helen</author><author>Hirsch, Ian</author><author>Hodgson, Susanne H C</author><author>Izu, Alane</author><author>Jackson, Susan</author><author>Jenkin, Daniel</author><author>Joe, Carina C D</author><author>Kerridge, Simon</author><author>Koen, Anthonet</author><author>Kwatra, Gaurav</author><author>Lazarus, Rajeka</author><author>Lawrie, Alison M</author><author>Lelliott, Alice</author><author>Libri, Vincenzo</author><author>Lillie, Patrick J</author><author>Mallory, Raburn</author><author>Mendes, Ana V A</author><author>Milan, Eveline P</author><author>Minassian, Angela M</author><author>McGregor, Alastair</author><author>Morrison, Hazel</author><author>Mujadidi, Yama F</author><author>Nana, Anusha</author><author>O’Reilly, Peter J</author><author>Padayachee, Sherman D</author><author>Pittella, Ana</author><author>Plested, Emma</author><author>Pollock, Katrina M</author><author>Ramasamy, Maheshi N</author><author>Rhead, Sarah</author><author>Schwarzbold, Alexandre V</author><author>Singh, Nisha</author><author>Smith, Andrew</author><author>Song, Rinn</author><author>Snape, Matthew D</author><author>Sprinz, Eduardo</author><author>Sutherland, Rebecca K</author><author>Tarrant, Richard</author><author>Thomson, Emma C</author><author>Török, M Estée</author><author>Toshner, Mark</author><author>Turner, David P J</author><author>Vekemans, Johan</author><author>Villafana, Tonya L</author><author>Watson, Marion E E</author><author>Williams, Christopher J</author><author>Douglas, Alexander D</author><author>Hill, Adrian V S</author><author>Lambe, Teresa</author><author>Gilbert, Sarah C</author><author>Pollard, Andrew J</author><author>Aban, Marites</author><author>Abayomi, Fatola</author><author>Abeyskera, Kushala</author><author>Aboagye, Jeremy</author><author>Adam, Matthew</author><author>Adams, Kirsty</author><author>Adamson, James</author><author>Adelaja, Yemi A.</author><author>Adlou, Syed</author><author>Ahmed, Khatija</author><author>Akhalwaya, Yasmeen</author><author>Akhalwaya, Saajida</author><author>Alcock, Andrew</author><author>Ali, Aabidah</author><author>Allen, Elizabeth R.</author><author>Allen, Lauren</author><author>Almeida, Thamires C.

The majority of residents have chronic illnesses and conditions and are vulnerable to infections and many share rooms and have congregate meals. There was evidence of inadequate registered nurse (RN) staffing levels and infection control procedures in many nursing homes prior to the outbreak of the virus. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship of nurse staffing in California nursing homes and compare homes with and without COVID-19 residents. Study data were from both the California and Los Angeles Departments of Public Health and as well as news organizations on nursing homes reporting COVID-19 infections between March and May 4, 2020. Results indicate that nursing homes with total RN staffing levels under the recommended minimum standard (0.75 hours per resident day) had a two times greater probability of having COVID-19 resident infections. Nursing homes with lower Medicare five-star ratings on total nurse and RN staffing levels (adjusted for acuity), higher total health deficiencies, and more beds had a higher probability of having COVID-19 residents. Nursing homes with low RN and total staffing levels appear to leave residents vulnerable to COVID-19 infections. Establishing minimum staffing standards at the federal and state levels could prevent this in the future.</abstract></record><record><database name="References.enl" path="References.enl">References.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Molinaro, Giuseppe A</author><author>Lee, Ping-ing</author><author>Lee, Dean A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>c or r e sp ondence Rotavirus Vaccines</title><secondary-title>Journal of Infectious Diseases, The</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Infectious Diseases, The</full-title></periodical><pages>1747-1751</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2006</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://nejmc2032195.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19, broadly referred to as “coronavirus”) a global pandemic, while thousands of infections and deaths are reported daily.

Assessing temporal variations in transmission in different countries is essential for evaluating the effectiveness of public health interventions and the impact of changes in policy.  Methods: We use case notification data to generate daily estimates of the time-dependent reproduction number in different regions and countries. Our modelling framework, based on open source tooling, accounts for reporting delays, so that temporal variations in reproduction number estimates can be compared directly with the times at which interventions are implemented.  Results: We provide three example uses of our framework. First, we demonstrate how the toolset displays temporal changes in the reproduction number. Second, we show how the framework can be used to reconstruct case counts by date of infection from case counts by date of notification, as well as to estimate the reproduction number. Third, we show how maps can be generated to clearly show if case numbers are likely to decrease or increase in different regions. Results are shown for regions and countries worldwide on our website ( https://epiforecasts.io/covid/ ) and are updated daily. Our tooling is provided as an open-source R package to allow replication by others.  Conclusions: This decision-support tool can be used to assess changes in virus transmission in different regions and countries worldwide. This allows policymakers to assess the effectiveness of current interventions, and will be useful for inferring whether or not transmission will increase when interventions are lifted. As well as providing daily updates on our website, we also provide adaptable computing code so that our approach can be used directly by researchers and policymakers on confidential datasets. We hope that our tool will be used to support decisions in countries worldwide throughout the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. </abstract></record><record><database name="References.enl" path="References.enl">References.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Silva, Petrônio C.L.</author><author>Batista, Paulo V.C.</author><author>Lima, Hélder S.</author><author>Alves, Marcos A.</author><author>Guimarães, Frederico G.</author><author>Silva, Rodrigo C.P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>COVID-ABS: An agent-based model of COVID-19 epidemic to simulate health and economic effects of social distancing interventions</title><secondary-title>Chaos, Solitons and Fractals</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Chaos, Solitons and Fractals</full-title></periodical><volume>139</volume><keywords><keyword>Agent-based simulation</keyword><keyword>COVID-19</keyword><keyword>Epidemic models</keyword><keyword>SEIR</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.chaos.2020.110088</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Silva et al. - 2020 - COVID-ABS An agent-based model of COVID-19 epidemic to simulate health and economic effects of social distancing i.pdf</url><url>internal-pdf://1-s2.0-S0960077920304859-main.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>The COVID-19 pandemic due to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has directly impacted the public health and economy worldwide. To overcome this problem, countries have adopted different policies and non-pharmaceutical interventions for controlling the spread of the virus. This paper proposes the COVID-ABS, a new SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) agent-based model that aims to simulate the pandemic dynamics using a society of agents emulating people, business and government. Seven different scenarios of social distancing interventions were analyzed, with varying epidemiological and economic effects: (1) do nothing, (2) lockdown, (3) conditional lockdown, (4) vertical isolation, (5) partial isolation, (6) use of face masks, and (7) use of face masks together with 50% of adhesion to social isolation. In the impossibility of implementing scenarios with lockdown, which present the lowest number of deaths and highest impact on the economy, scenarios combining the use of face masks and partial isolation can be the more realistic for implementation in terms of social cooperation. The COVID-ABS model was implemented in Python programming language, with source code publicly available. The model can be easily extended to other societies by changing the input parameters, as well as allowing the creation of a multitude of other scenarios. Therefore, it is a useful tool to assist politicians and health authorities to plan their actions against the COVID-19 epidemic.</abstract></record><record><database name="References.enl" path="References.enl">References.enl</database><ref-type name="Report">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Joan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>General COVID Vaccine Plans</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://COVID19 GENERAL Vaccine Lit Review.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="References.enl" path="References.enl">References.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nuño, M.</author><author>Reichert, T.

However, early in a pandemic, vaccines will not likely be available and antivirals will probably be of limited supply. The containment of pandemic influenza within acute-care hospitals anywhere is problematic because of open connections with communities. However, other health care institutions, especially those providing care for the disabled, can potentially control community access. We modeled a residential care facility by using a stochastic compartmental model to address the question of whether conditions exist under which nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) alone might prevent the introduction of a pandemic virus. The model projected that with currently recommended staff-visitor interactions and social distancing practices, virus introductions are inevitable in all pandemics, accompanied by rapid internal propagation. The model identified staff reentry as the critical pathway of contagion, and provided estimates of the reduction in risk required to minimize the probability of a virus introduction. By using information on latency for historical and candidate pandemic viruses, we developed NPIs that simulated notions of protective isolation for staff away from the facility that reduced the probability of bringing the pandemic infection back to the facility to levels providing protection over a large range of projected pandemic severities. The proposed form of protective isolation was evaluated for social plausibility by collaborators who operate residential facilities. It appears unavoidable that NPI combinations effective against pandemics more severe than mild imply social disruption that increases with severity. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.</abstract></record><record><database name="References.enl" path="References.enl">References.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yang, Lin</author><author>Dai, Jingyi</author><author>Zhao, Jun</author><author>Wang, Yunfu</author><author>Deng, Pingji</author><author>Wang, Jing</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimation of incubation period and serial interval of COVID-19: Analysis of 178 cases and 131 transmission chains in Hubei province, China</title><secondary-title>Epidemiology and Infection</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Epidemiology and Infection</full-title></periodical><pages>0-5</pages><keywords><keyword>Coronavirus</keyword><keyword>Epidemiology</keyword><keyword>Incubation period</keyword><keyword>Infectious disease</keyword><keyword>Serial interval</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32594928</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/S0950268820001338</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Yang et al. - 2020 - Estimation of incubation period and serial interval of COVID-19 Analysis of 178 cases and 131 transmission chains i.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>A novel coronavirus disease, designated as COVID-19, has become a pandemic worldwide. This study aimed to estimate the incubation period and serial interval of COVID-19. We collected contact tracing data in a municipality in Hubei province during a full outbreak period. The date of infection and infector-infectee pairs were inferred from the history of travel in Wuhan or exposed to confirmed cases. The incubation periods and serial intervals were estimated using parametric accelerated failure time models, accounting for interval censoring of the exposures. Our estimated median incubation period of COVID-19 is 5.4 days (bootstrapped 95% CI: 4.8-6.0), and the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles are 1 and 15 days respectively; while the estimated serial interval of COVID-19 falls within the range of -4 to 13 days with 95% confidence and has a median of 4.6 days (95% CI: 3.7-5.5). Ninety-five per cent of symptomatic cases showed symptoms by 13.7 days (95% CI: 12.5-14.9). The incubation periods and serial intervals were not significant different between male and female, and among age groups. Our results suggest a considerable proportion of secondary transmission occurred prior to symptom onset. And the current practice of 14-day quarantine period in many regions is reasonable.</abstract></record><record><database name="References.enl" path="References.enl">References.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jackson, Michael L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Low-Impact Social Distancing Interventions to Mitigate Local Epidemics of SARS-CoV-2</title></titles><periodical/><pages>1-12</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Jackson - 2020 - Low-Impact Social Distancing Interventions to Mitigate Local Epidemics of SARS-CoV-2.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="References.enl" path="References.enl">References.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mayr, Verena</author><author>Nuβbaumer-Streit, Barbara</author><author>Gartlehner, Gerald</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quarantine Alone or in Combination with Other Public Health Measures to Control COVID-19: A Rapid Review (Review)</title><secondary-title>Gesundheitswesen</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Gesundheitswesen</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Pandemic</keyword><keyword>SARS-COV-2</keyword><keyword>WHO</keyword><keyword>World Health Organization</keyword><keyword>coronavirus</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32413914</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1055/a-1164-6611</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Background COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is a new, rapidly emerging zoonotic infectious disease, that was reported to the World Health Organization for the first time on 31 December 2019. Currently, no effective pharmacological interventions or vaccines are available to treat or prevent COVID-19, therefore nonpharmacological public health measures are more in focus. Objectives The aim was to assess the effects of quarantine - alone or in combination with other measures - during coronavirus outbreaks. Methods Because of the current COVID-19 pandemic, WHO commissioned a rapid review. To save time, the method of systematic reviews was slightly and with caution modified. This publication is a summary of the most important aspects of the rapid review, translated into German by members of the WHO Collaborating Centre at the Danube University Krems (Austria). Results Overall, 29 studies were included. Ten modeling studies focused on COVID-19, 4 observational studies and 15 modeling studies focused on SARS and MERS. The modeling studies consistently reported a benefit of the simulated quarantine measures. For example, the models estimated that quarantine of people exposed to confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 prevented between 44 and 81% of the cases that would otherwise have happened and 31 to 63% of the deaths, when compared to no such measures. In regard to costs, the earlier the quarantine measures are implemented, the greater the cost savings will be. Conclusion Our confidence in the evidence is very limited. This is mainly because the COVID-19 studies based their models on the limited data that have been available in the early weeks of the pandemic and made different assumptions about the virus. The studies of SARS and MERS are not completely generalizable to COVID-19. Despite only having limited evidence, all the studies found quarantine to be important for controlling the spread of severe coronavirus diseases. Looking to the coming months, in order to maintain the best possible balance of measures, decision makers must continue to constantly monitor the outbreak situation and the impact of the measures they implement.</abstract></record><record><database name="References.enl" path="References.enl">References.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tsai, Alexander C</author><author>Harling, Guy</author><author>Reynolds, Zahra</author><author>Gilbert, Rebecca F</author><author>Siedner, Mark J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>COVID-19 transmission in the U.S. before vs. after relaxation of statewide social distancing measures</title><secondary-title>Clinical Infectious Diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Clinical Infectious Diseases</full-title></periodical><pages>1-7</pages><volume>2019</volume><issue>Xx Xxxx</issue><keywords><keyword>000</keyword><keyword>2</keyword><keyword>acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus</keyword><keyword>ally</keyword><keyword>basic reproductive number</keyword><keyword>covid-19</keyword><keyword>epidemic of severe</keyword><keyword>glob-</keyword><keyword>having surpassed 7 million</keyword><keyword>home to the largest</keyword><keyword>public health regulations</keyword><keyword>reported cases and 200</keyword><keyword>sars-cov-2</keyword><keyword>social distancing</keyword><keyword>the united states is</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/cid/ciaa1502</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://ciaa1502.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Using segmented linear regression, we evaluated how state government relaxation of social distancing measures affected the time-varying effective reproduction number.

Safe and effective vaccines are needed urgently. METHODS In an ongoing multinational, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, pivotal efficacy trial, we randomly assigned persons 16 years of age or older in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses, 21 days apart, of either placebo or the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate (30 μg per dose). BNT162b2 is a lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine that encodes a prefusion stabilized, membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein. The primary end points were efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and safety. RESULTS A total of 43,548 participants underwent randomization, of whom 43,448 received injections: 21,720 with BNT162b2 and 21,728 with placebo. There were 8 cases of Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose among participants assigned to receive BNT162b2 and 162 cases among those assigned to placebo; BNT162b2 was 95% effective in preventing Covid-19 (95% credible interval, 90.3 to 97.6). Similar vaccine efficacy (generally 90 to 100%) was observed across subgroups defined by age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline body-mass index, and the presence of coexisting conditions. Among 10 cases of severe Covid-19 with onset after the first dose, 9 occurred in placebo recipients and 1 in a BNT162b2 recipient. The safety profile of BNT162b2 was characterized by short-term, mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headache. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and was similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. CONCLUSIONS A two-dose regimen of BNT162b2 conferred 95% protection against Covid-19 in persons 16 years of age or older. Safety over a median of 2 months was similar to that of other viral vaccines.

We aimed to investigate the effects of physical distance, face masks, and eye protection on virus transmission in health-care and non-health-care (eg, community) settings. Methods: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the optimum distance for avoiding person-to-person virus transmission and to assess the use of face masks and eye protection to prevent transmission of viruses. We obtained data for SARS-CoV-2 and the betacoronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome, and Middle East respiratory syndrome from 21 standard WHO-specific and COVID-19-specific sources. We searched these data sources from database inception to May 3, 2020, with no restriction by language, for comparative studies and for contextual factors of acceptability, feasibility, resource use, and equity. We screened records, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias in duplicate. We did frequentist and Bayesian meta-analyses and random-effects meta-regressions. We rated the certainty of evidence according to Cochrane methods and the GRADE approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020177047. Findings: Our search identified 172 observational studies across 16 countries and six continents, with no randomised controlled trials and 44 relevant comparative studies in health-care and non-health-care settings (n=25 697 patients). Transmission of viruses was lower with physical distancing of 1 m or more, compared with a distance of less than 1 m (n=10 736, pooled adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0·18, 95% CI 0·09 to 0·38; risk difference [RD] −10·2%, 95% CI −11·5 to −7·5; moderate certainty); protection was increased as distance was lengthened (change in relative risk [RR] 2·02 per m; pinteraction=0·041; moderate certainty). Face mask use could result in a large reduction in risk of infection (n=2647; aOR 0·15, 95% CI 0·07 to 0·34, RD −14·3%, −15·9 to −10·7; low certainty), with stronger associations with N95 or similar respirators compared with disposable surgical masks or similar (eg, reusable 12–16-layer cotton masks; pinteraction=0·090; posterior probability &gt;95%, low certainty). Eye protection also was associated with less infection (n=3713; aOR 0·22, 95% CI 0·12 to 0·39, RD −10·6%, 95% CI −12·5 to −7·7; low certainty). Unadjusted studies and subgroup and sensitivity analyses showed similar findings. Interpretation: The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis support physical distancing of 1 m or more and provide quantitative estimates for models and contact tracing to inform policy. Optimum use of face masks, respirators, and eye protection in public and health-care settings should be informed by these findings and contextual factors. Robust randomised trials are needed to better inform the evidence for these interventions, but this systematic appraisal of currently best available evidence might inform interim guidance.

Their safety and efficacy in older people is critical to their success. Though care home residents and older people are likely to be amongst the first to be vaccinated, these patient groups are usually excluded from clinical trials. Data from several Phase II trials have given cause for optimism, with strong antibody responses and reassuring safety profiles but, with the exception of AstraZeneca’s vaccine, recruited few older people. Overall, the sparse data from Phase II trials suggest a reduction in both antibody responses and mild to moderate adverse events in well older people compared to younger participants. Many of the Phase III trials have made a conscious effort to recruit more older people, and interim analyses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine have led to press releases announcing high degrees of efficacy. However, older people with co-morbidities and frailty have once again been largely excluded and there are no published data on safety and efficacy in this group. Although the speed and impact of the pandemic on older people with frailty justify an approach where they are offered vaccination first, patients and their carers and supervising health care professionals alike will need to make a decision on accepting vaccination based on limited evidence. Here we review the main candidate vaccines that may become available, with a focus on the evidence of safety and efficacy in older people.</abstract></record><record><database name="References.enl" path="References.enl">References.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Silva, Petrnio C.L.</author><author>Batista, Paulo V.C.</author><author>Lima, Hlder S.</author><author>Alves, Marcos A.</author><author>Guimares, Frederico G.</author><author>Silva, Rodrigo C.P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>COVID-ABS: An agent-based model of COVID-19 epidemic to simulate health and economic effects of social distancing interventions</title><secondary-title>arXiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>arXiv</full-title></periodical><issue>January</issue><keywords><keyword>Agent-based Simulation</keyword><keyword>COVID-19</keyword><keyword>Epidemic models</keyword><keyword>SEIR</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://main.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>The COVID-19 pandemic due to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus have directly impacted the public health and economy. To overcome this problem, the countries have adopted different policies for controlling the spread of the virus. This paper proposes the COVID-ABS, a new SEIR agent-based model that aims to simulate the pandemic dynamics using a society of agents emulating people, business and government. Seven different scenarios varying epidemiological and economical effects of social distance interventions were performed, which are: (1) do nothing, (2) lockdown, (3) conditional lockdown, (4) vertical isolation, (5) partial isolation, (6) use of face masks, and (7) use of face masks together with 50% of adhesion to social isolation. In the impossibility of implementing scenarios with lockdown which present the lowest number of deaths and highest impact on the economy, scenarios combining the use of face masks and partial isolation can be the more realistic for implementation in terms of social cooperation. The model can be easily extended to new societies by varying the parameters as well as allows the creating of a multitude of other scenarios.</abstract></record><record><database name="References.enl" path="References.enl">References.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Table, Supplementary</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>OpenABM-Covid19 - an agent-based model for non-pharmaceutical interventions against COVID-19 including contact tracing Supplementary tables : Supplementary Table 1 : Percentage of age-stratified population of the UK and percentage of households containing</title></titles><periodical/><pages>1-23</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2020.09.16.20195925v1.full.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="References.enl" path="References.enl">References.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yi, Sarah H</author><author>See, Isaac</author><author>Kent, Alyssa G</author><author>Vlachos, Nicholas</author><author>Whitworth, J Carrie</author><author>Xu, Kerui</author><author>Gouin, Katryna A.</author><author>Zhang, Shirley</author><author>Slifka, Kara Jacobs</author><author>Sauer, Ann Goding</author><author>Kutty, Preeta K.</author><author>Perz, Joseph F.</author><author>Stone, Nimalie D.</author><author>Stuckey, Matthew J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Characterization of COVID-19 in Assisted Living Facilities — 39 States, October 2020</title><secondary-title>MMWR.

These restrictive measures have an enormous impact on residents' well-being and pose dilemmas for staff, although primary data are lacking. A Dutch guideline was developed to cautiously open nursing homes for visitors during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study reports the first findings on how the guideline was applied in the local context; the compliance to local protocols; and the impact on well-being of residents, their family caregivers, and staff. Design: A mixed-methods cross-sectional study was conducted. Setting and Participants: In total, 26 nursing homes were permitted to enlarge their possibilities for allowing visitors in their facility. These nursing homes were proportionally representative of the Netherlands as they were selected by their local Area Health Authority for participation. At each nursing home, a contact person was selected for participation in the current study. Methods: A mixed-methods cross-sectional study was conducted, consisting of questionnaire, telephone interviews, analyses of documentation (ie, local visiting protocols), and a WhatsApp group. Results: Variation in local protocols was observed, for example, related to the use of personal protective equipment, location, and supervision of visits. In general, experiences were very positive. All nursing homes recognized the added value of real and personal contact between residents and their loved ones and indicated a positive impact on well-being. Compliance with local guidelines was sufficient to good. No new COVID-19 infections were reported during this time. Conclusions and Implications: These results indicate the value of family visitation in nursing homes and positive impact of visits. Based on these results, the Dutch government has decided to allow all nursing homes in the Netherlands to cautiously open their homes using the guidelines. More research is needed on impact and long-term compliance.</abstract></record><record><database name="References.enl" path="References.enl">References.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mantzaris, Alexander V</author><author>Garibay, Ivan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>I NVESTIGATING DYNAMICS OF COVID-19 SPREAD AND CONTAINMENT WITH AGENT - BASED MODELING</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://2020.08.18.20177451v1.full.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="References.enl" path="References.enl">References.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Larson, Derek</author><author>Brodniak, Sterling L</author><author>Voegtly, Logan J</author><author>Cer, Regina Z</author><author>Glang, Lindsay A</author><author>Malagon, Francisco J</author><author>Long, Kyle A</author><author>Potocki, Ronald</author><author>Smith, Darci R</author><author>Lanteri, Charlotte</author><author>Burgess, Timothy</author><author>Bishop-Lilly, Kimberly A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Case of Early Reinfection With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)</title><secondary-title>Clinical Infectious Diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Clinical Infectious Diseases</full-title></periodical><pages>1-2</pages><issue>Xx Xxxx</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/cid/ciaa1436</electronic-resource-num><notes>## Highlights:

An aggregated study-level meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the magnitude and dose-relationship of the clinical effect of approved doses of vortioxetine (5-20mg/day). The primary outcome measure was change from baseline to endpoint in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score. Differences from placebo were analyzed using mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM) analysis, with a sensitivity analysis also conducted using last observation carried forward. Secondary outcomes included MADRS single-item scores, response rate (≥50% reduction in baseline MADRS), remission rate (MADRS ≤10), and Clinical Global Impressions scores. Across the 11 studies, 1824 patients were treated with placebo and 3304 with vortioxetine (5mg/day: n=1001; 10mg/day: n=1042; 15mg/day: n=449; 20mg/day: n=812). The MMRM meta-analysis demonstrated that vortioxetine 5, 10, and 20mg/day were associated with significant reductions in MADRS total score (Δ-2.27, Δ-3.57, and Δ-4.57, respectively; p&lt;0.01) versus placebo. The effects of 15mg/day (Δ-2.60; p=0.105) were not significantly different from placebo. Vortioxetine 10 and 20mg/day were associated with significant reductions in 9 of 10 MADRS single-item scores. Vortioxetine treatment was also associated with significantly higher rates of response and remission and with significant improvements in other depression-related scores versus placebo. This meta-analysis of vortioxetine (5-20mg/day) in adults with MDD supports the efficacy demonstrated in the individual studies, with treatment effect increasing with dose.</abstract></record><record><database name="References.enl" path="References.enl">References.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lauer, Stephen A.</author><author>Grantz, Kyra H.</author><author>Bi, Qifang</author><author>Jones, Forrest K.</author><author>Zheng, Qulu</author><author>Meredith, Hannah R.</author><author>Azman, Andrew S.</author><author>Reich, Nicholas G.</author><author>Lessler, Justin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The incubation period of coronavirus disease 2019 (CoVID-19) from publicly reported confirmed cases: Estimation and application</title><secondary-title>Annals of Internal Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of Internal Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>577-582</pages><volume>172</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32150748</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.7326/M20-0504</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Lauer et al. - 2020 - The incubation period of coronavirus disease 2019 (CoVID-19) from publicly reported confirmed cases Estimation and.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Background: A novel human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in China in December 2019. There is limited support for many of its key epidemiologic features, including the incubation period for clinical disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]), which has important implications for surveillance and control activities. Objective: To estimate the length of the incubation period of COVID-19 and describe its public health implications. Design: Pooled analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between 4 January 2020 and 24 February 2020. Setting: News reports and press releases from 50 provinces, regions, and countries outside Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Participants: Persons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection outside Hubei province, China. Measurements: Patient demographic characteristics and dates and times of possible exposure, symptom onset, fever onset, and hospitalization. Results: There were 181 confirmed cases with identifiable exposure and symptom onset windows to estimate the incubation period of COVID-19. The median incubation period was estimated to be 5.1 days (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days), and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days) of infection. These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 101 out of every 10 000 cases (99th percentile, 482) will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine. Limitation: Publicly reported cases may overrepresent severe cases, the incubation period for which may differ from that of mild cases. Conclusion: This work provides additional evidence for a median incubation period for COVID-19 of approximately 5 days, similar to SARS. Our results support current proposals for the length of quarantine or active monitoring of persons potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2, although longer monitoring periods might be justified in extreme cases.

While minimizing human contact is effective in managing the outbreak, it causes severe economic losses. Strategies solving this dilemma by considering interrelation between the spread of the virus and economic activities are in urgent needs for mitigating the health and economic damage. Here we propose an abstract agent-based model for the outbreak of COVID-19 in which economic activities are taken into account. The computational simulation of the model recapitulated the trade-off between health and economic damage associated with lockdown measures. Based on the simulation results, we discuss how macroscopic dynamics of infection and economy emerge from the individuals behaviours. We believe our model can serve as a platform for discussing solutions to the above-mentioned dilemma.</abstract></record><record><database name="References.enl" path="References.enl">References.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Aleta, Alberto</author><author>Martín-Corral, David</author><author>Pastore y Piontti, Ana</author><author>Ajelli, Marco</author><author>Litvinova, Maria</author><author>Chinazzi, Matteo</author><author>Dean, Natalie E.</author><author>Halloran, M.

Buildings hosting the continuous presence of the same users and significant overcrowd conditions over space/time (e.g. large offices, universities) are critical scenarios due to the prolonged contact with infectors. Beside individual’s risk-mitigation strategies performed (facial masks), stakeholders should promote additional strategies, i.e. occupants’ load limitation (towards “social distancing”) and access control. Simulators could support the measures effectiveness evaluation. This work provides an Agent-Based Model to estimate the virus spreading in the closed built environment. The model adopts a probabilistic approach to jointly simulate occupants’ movement and virus transmission according to proximity-based and exposure-time-based rules proposed by international health organizations. Scenarios can be defined in terms of building occupancy, mitigation strategies and virus-related aspects. The model is calibrated on experimental data (“Diamond Princess” cruise) and then applied to a relevant case-study (a part of a university campus). Results demonstrate the model capabilities. Concerning the case-study, adopting facial masks seems to be a paramount strategy to reduce virus spreading in each initial condition, by maintaining an acceptable infected people’s number. The building capacity limitation could support such measure by potentially moving from FFPk masks to surgical masks use by occupants (thus improving users’ comfort issues). A preliminary model to combine acceptable mask filters-occupants’ density combination is proposed. The model could be modified to consider other recurring scenarios in other public buildings (e.g. tourist facilities, cultural buildings).</abstract></record></records></xml>
